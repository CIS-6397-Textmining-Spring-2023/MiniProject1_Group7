'' `` wo'n't ! '' thought alice , , waiting till fancied heard rabbit , window , suddenly spread hand , made snatch air . get hold anything , heard little shriek fall crash breaking glass , concluded possible fallen cucumber-frame , something sort . [ illustration ] next came angry voice -- rabbit 's -- '' pat , pat ! ? '' voice never heard , `` shure 'm ! digging apples , anyway , yer honour ! '' `` digging apples indeed !

'' last spread hand made another snatch air . time two little shrieks , breaking glass -- '' number cucumber-frames must ! '' thought alice , `` wonder 'll next ! pulling window , wish could ! 'm sure n't want stop longer ! '' waited time without hearing anything : last came rumbling little cart-wheels , sound good many voices talking together : made words `` where's ladder ? -- , n't bring one , bill 's got -- , put 'em corner -- , tie 'em together first -- n't reach high enough yet -- oh , 'll well enough , n't particular -- , bill ! catch hold rope -- roof bear ? -- mind loose slate -- oh , 's coming ! heads ! -- '' ( loud crash ) `` , ? -- bill , fancy -- 's go chimney ? -- nay , sha'n't ! ! -- wo n't -- bill 's got go -- , bill ! master says 've go chimney !

[ illustration ] first thing general chorus `` goes bill ! '' rabbit 's voice alone `` catch , hedge ! '' silence , another confusion voices , `` , old fellow ? happened ? tell us . '' last came little feeble squeaking voice , ( `` 's bill '' thought alice , ) said `` well , hardly know -- 'm fluster -- something comes like jack-in-the-box , next minute goes like rocket ! '' `` , old fellow ! '' said voices . `` must burn house ! '' said voice rabbit , alice called loud could `` , 'll set dinah ! '' caused silence , alice thinking '' get dinah ? '' found great delight getting smaller : soon able get uncomfortable position lying , two three minutes three inches high . ran house quick could , found quite crowd little animals waiting outside -- guinea-pigs , white mice , squirrels , `` bill '' little green lizard , supported arms one guinea-pigs , another giving something bottle . made rush moment appeared , alice ran hardest , soon found thick wood . [ illustration ] chapter iii [ illustration ] '' first thing 've got , '' said alice , wandered wood , `` grow right size , second thing find way lovely garden . think best plan . '' sounded excellent plan , doubt , neatly simply arranged : difficulty , smallest idea set , peering anxiously among trees round , little sharp bark head made look great hurry . enormous puppy looking large round eyes , feebly stretching one paw , trying reach : `` poor thing ! '' said alice coaxing tone , tried hard whistle , terribly alarmed thought might hungry , case would probably devour spite coaxing . hardly knowing , picked little bit stick , held puppy : whereupon puppy jumped air feet , yelp delight rushed stick , made believe worry alice dodged behind great thistle keep run , , moment appeared side , puppy made another dart stick , tumbled head heels hurry get hold : alice , thinking like game play cart-horse , expecting every moment trampled feet , ran round thistle : puppy begin series short charges stick , running little way forwards time long way back , barking hoarsely , till last sat good way , panting , tongue hanging mouth , great eyes half shut . seemed alice good opportunity making escape . set , ran till puppy 's bark sounded quite faint distance , till quite tired breath . `` yet dear little puppy ! '' said alice , leant buttercup rest , fanned hat . `` liked teaching tricks , -- i'd right size ! oh ! 'd nearly forgotten 've got grow ! let see ; _is_ managed ? suppose ought eat drink something , great question ? '' great question certainly , ? alice looked round flowers blades grass could see anything looked like right thing eat circumstances . large mushroom near , height , looked , sides , behind , occurred look see top . stretched tiptoe , peeped edge mushroom , eyes immediately met large blue caterpillar , sitting arms folded , quietly smoking long hookah , taking least notice anything else . [ illustration ] time looked silence : last caterpillar took hookah mouth , languidly addressed . `` ? '' said caterpillar . encouraging opening conversation : alice replied rather shyly , `` -- hardly know , sir , present -- least know got morning , think must changed several times since . '' `` mean ? '' said caterpillar , `` explain ! '' `` ca'n't explain , 'm afraid , sir , '' said alice , `` 'm , see . '' `` n't see , '' said caterpillar . `` 'm afraid ca n't put clearly , '' alice replied politely , `` ca'n't understand , really many different sizes one day confusing . '' `` n't , '' said caterpillar . `` well , perhaps n't found yet , '' said alice , `` turn chrysalis , know , butterfly , think 'll feel little queer , n't think ?

'' brought back beginning conversation : alice felt little irritated caterpillar making short remarks , drew said gravely `` think ought tell , first . '' `` ? '' said caterpillar . another puzzling question : alice reason ready , caterpillar seemed bad temper , turned round walked away . `` come back ! '' caterpillar called , `` 've something important say ! '' sounded promising : alice turned came back . `` keep temper , '' said caterpillar . `` ? '' said alice , swallowing anger well could . `` , '' said caterpillar . alice thought might well wait , nothing else , perhaps caterpillar might tell something worth hearing . minutes puffed away hookah without speaking , last unfolded arms , took hookah mouth , said `` think changed , ? '' `` yes , sir , '' said alice , `` ca'n't remember things used know -- 've tried say `` doth little busy bee '' came different ! '' `` try repeat `` old , father william '' , '' said caterpillar . alice folded hands , began : [ illustration ] 1 . `` old , father william , '' young man said , `` hair exceedingly white : yet incessantly stand head -- think , age , right ?

'' 8 . `` answered three questions , enough , '' said father , `` n't give airs ! think listen day stuff ? , 'll kick stairs ! '' `` said right , '' said caterpillar . `` quite right , 'm afraid , '' said alice timidly , `` words got altered . '' `` wrong beginning end , '' said caterpillar decidedly , silence minutes : caterpillar first speak . `` size want ?

'' said caterpillar . `` well , like little larger , sir , mind , '' said alice , `` three inches wretched height . '' `` good height indeed ! '' said caterpillar loudly angrily , rearing straight spoke ( exactly three inches high ) . `` 'm used ! '' pleaded poor alice piteous tone , thought `` wish creatures would n't easily offended ! '' `` 'll get used time , '' said caterpillar , put hookah mouth , began smoking . time alice waited quietly chose speak : minutes caterpillar took hookah mouth , got mushroom , crawled away grass , merely remarking went ; `` top make grow taller , stalk make grow shorter . '' `` top ? stalk ? '' thought alice . `` mushroom , '' said caterpillar , asked aloud , another moment sight . alice remained looking thoughtfully mushroom minute , picked carefully broke two , taking stalk one hand , top . [ illustration ] '' stalk ?

'' said alice tone delight , changed alarm another moment , found shoulders nowhere seen : looked upon immense length neck , seemed rise like stalk sea green leaves lay far . [ illustration ] '' green stuff ? '' said alice , `` shoulders got ? oh ! poor hands ! ca'n't see ? '' moving spoke , result seemed follow , except little rustling among leaves . tried bring head hands , delighted find neck would bend easily every direction , like serpent . succeeded bending beautiful zig-zag , going dive among leaves , found tops trees wood wandering , sharp hiss made draw back : large pigeon flown face , violently beating wings . [ illustration ] '' serpent ! '' screamed pigeon . `` 'm serpent ! '' said alice indignantly , `` let alone ! '' `` 've tried every way ! '' pigeon said desperately , kind sob : `` nothing seems suit 'em ! '' `` n't least idea mean , '' said alice . `` 've tried roots trees , 've tried banks , i've tried hedges , '' pigeon went without attending , `` serpents ! 's pleasing 'em ! '' alice puzzled , thought use saying anything till pigeon finished . `` n't trouble enough hatching eggs ! '' said pigeon , `` without look serpents , day night ! , n't wink sleep three weeks ! '' `` 'm sorry 've annoyed , '' said alice , beginning see meaning . `` 'd taken highest tree wood , '' said pigeon raising voice shriek , `` thinking free 'em last , must needs come sky ! ugh ! serpent !

'' `` tasted eggs , certainly , '' said alice , truthful child , `` indeed do'n't want . do'n't like raw . '' `` well , , ! '' said pigeon , settled nest . alice crouched among trees , well could , neck kept getting entangled among branches , several times stop untwist . soon remembered pieces mushroom still held hands , set work carefully , nibbling first one , growing sometimes taller sometimes shorter , succeeded bringing usual size . long since right size felt quite strange first , got quite used minute two , began talking usual : `` well ! there's half plan done ! puzzling changes ! i'm never sure 'm going , one minute another ! however , 've got right size : next thing , get beautiful garden -- done , wonder ? '' said , noticed one trees doorway leading right . `` 's curious ! '' thought , `` everything 's curious today : may well go . '' went . found long hall , close little glass table : `` , 'll manage better time '' said , began taking little golden key , unlocking door led garden . set work eating pieces mushroom till fifteen inches high : walked little passage : -- found last beautiful garden , among bright flowerbeds cool fountains . [ illustration ] chapter iv [ illustration ] large rose tree stood near entrance garden : roses white , three gardeners , busily painting red . alice thought curious thing , went near watch , came heard one say `` look , five ! n't go splashing paint like !
