conseil admired first time . atmosphere towards southern horizon stretched white dazzling band . english whalers given name “ ice blink. ” however thick clouds may , always visible , announces presence ice pack bank . accordingly , larger blocks soon appeared , whose brilliancy changed caprices fog . masses showed green veins , long undulating lines traced sulphate copper ; others resembled enormous amethysts light shining . reflected light day upon thousand crystal facets . others shaded vivid calcareous reflections resembled perfect town marble . neared south floating islands increased number importance . 60° lat . every pass disappeared . , seeking carefully , captain nemo soon found narrow opening , boldly slipped , knowing , however , would close behind . thus , guided clever hand , _nautilus_ passed ice precision quite charmed conseil ; icebergs mountains , ice-fields smooth plains , seeming limits , drift-ice floating ice-packs , plains broken , called palchs circular , streams made long strips . temperature low ; thermometer exposed air marked 2 deg . 3° zero , warmly clad fur , expense sea-bear seal . interior _nautilus_ , warmed regularly electric apparatus , defied intense cold . besides , would necessary go yards beneath waves find bearable temperature . two months earlier perpetual daylight latitudes ; already three four hours night , would six months darkness circumpolar regions . 15th march latitude new shetland south orkney . captain told formerly numerous tribes seals inhabited ; english american whalers , rage destruction , massacred old young ; thus , life animation , left silence death . eight ’ clock morning 16th march _nautilus_ , following fifty-fifth meridian , cut antarctic polar circle . ice surrounded us sides , closed horizon . captain nemo went one opening another , still going higher . express astonishment beauties new regions . ice took surprising forms . grouping formed oriental town , innumerable mosques minarets ; fallen city thrown earth , , convulsion nature . whole aspect constantly changed oblique rays sun , lost greyish fog amidst hurricanes snow . detonations falls heard sides , great overthrows icebergs , altered whole landscape like diorama . often seeing exit , thought definitely prisoners ; , instinct guiding slightest indication , captain nemo would discover new pass . never mistaken saw thin threads bluish water trickling along ice-fields ; doubt already ventured midst antarctic seas . 16th march , however , ice-fields absolutely blocked road . iceberg , yet , vast fields cemented cold . obstacle could stop captain nemo : hurled frightful violence . _nautilus_ entered brittle mass like wedge , split frightful crackings . battering ram ancients hurled infinite strength . ice , thrown high air , fell like hail around us . power impulsion apparatus made canal ; times carried away impetus , lodged ice-field , crushing weight , sometimes buried beneath , dividing simple pitching movement , producing large rents . violent gales assailed us time , accompanied thick fogs , , one end platform , could see nothing . wind blew sharply parts compass , snow lay hard heaps break blows pickaxe . temperature always 5 deg . zero ; every outward part _nautilus_ covered ice . rigged vessel would entangled blocked gorges . vessel without sails , electricity motive power , wanting coal , could alone brave high latitudes . length , 18th march , many useless assaults , _nautilus_ positively blocked . longer either streams , packs , ice-fields , interminable immovable barrier , formed mountains soldered together . “ iceberg ! ” said canadian . knew ned land , well navigators preceded us , inevitable obstacle . sun appearing instant noon , captain nemo took observation near possible , gave situation 51° 30′ long . 67° 39′ s. lat . advanced one degree antarctic region . liquid surface sea longer glimpse . spur _nautilus_ lay stretched vast plain , entangled confused blocks . sharp points slender needles rising height 200 feet ; steep shore , hewn axe clothed greyish tints ; huge mirrors , reflecting rays sunshine , half drowned fog . desolate face nature stern silence reigned , scarcely broken flapping wings petrels puffins . everything frozen—even noise . _nautilus_ obliged stop adventurous course amid fields ice . spite efforts , spite powerful means employed break ice , _nautilus_ remained immovable . generally , proceed , return still open us ; return impossible advance , every pass closed behind us ; moments stationary , likely entirely blocked , indeed happen two ’ clock afternoon , fresh ice forming around sides astonishing rapidity . obliged admit captain nemo imprudent . platform moment . captain observing situation time past , said : “ well , sir , think ? ” “ think caught , captain. ” [ illustration ] _nautilus_ blocked “ , m. aronnax , really think _nautilus_ disengage ? ” “ difficulty , captain ; season already far advanced reckon breaking ice. ” “ ah ! sir , ” said captain nemo , ironical tone , “ always . see nothing difficulties obstacles . affirm _nautilus_ disengage , also go still. ” “ south ? ” asked , looking captain . “ yes , sir ; shall go pole. ” “ pole ! ” exclaimed , unable repress gesture incredulity . “ yes , ” replied captain , coldly , “ antarctic pole—to unknown point whence springs every meridian globe . know whether please _nautilus ! _ ” yes , knew . knew man bold , even rashness . conquer obstacles bristled round south pole , rendering inaccessible north , yet reached boldest navigators—was mad enterprise , one maniac would conceived ? came head ask captain nemo ever discovered pole never yet trodden human creature ? “ , sir , ” replied ; “ discover together . others failed , fail . never yet led _nautilus_ far southern seas ; , repeat , shall go yet. ” “ well believe , captain , ” said , slightly ironical tone . “ believe ! let us go ahead ! obstacles us ! let us smash iceberg ! let us blow ; , resists , let us give _nautilus_ wings fly ! ” “ , sir ! ” said captain nemo , quietly ; “ , , ! ” “ ! ” exclaimed , sudden idea captain ’ projects flashing upon mind . understood ; wonderful qualities _nautilus_ going serve us superhuman enterprise . “ see beginning understand one another , sir , ” said captain , half smiling . “ begin see possibility—i say success—of attempt . impossible ordinary vessel easy _nautilus_ . continent lies pole , must stop continent ; , contrary , pole washed open sea , go even pole. ” “ certainly , ” said , carried away captain ’ reasoning ; “ surface sea solidified ice , lower depths free providential law placed maximum density waters ocean one degree higher freezing-point ; , mistaken , portion iceberg water one four below. ” “ nearly , sir ; one foot iceberg sea three . ice mountains 300 feet surface , 900 beneath . 900 feet _nautilus ? _ ” “ nothing , sir. ” “ could even seek greater depths uniform temperature sea-water , brave impunity thirty forty degrees surface cold. ” “ , sir—just , ” replied , getting animated . “ difficulty , ” continued captain nemo , “ remaining several days without renewing provision air. ” “ ? _nautilus_ vast reservoirs ; fill , supply us oxygen want. ” “ well thought , m. aronnax , ” replied captain , smiling . “ , wishing accuse rashness , first give objections. ” “ make ? ” “ one . possible , sea exists south pole , may covered ; , consequently , shall unable come surface. ” “ good , sir ! forget _nautilus_ armed powerful spur , could send diagonally fields ice , would open shocks. ” “ ah ! sir , full ideas to-day. ” “ besides , captain , ” added , enthusiastically , “ find sea open south pole well north ? frozen poles earth coincide , either southern northern regions ; , proved contrary , may suppose either continent ocean free ice two points globe. ” “ think , m. aronnax , ” replied captain nemo . “ wish observe , made many objections project , crushing arguments favour ! ” preparations audacious attempt began . powerful pumps _nautilus_ working air reservoirs storing high pressure . four ’ clock , captain nemo announced closing panels platform . threw one last look massive iceberg going cross . weather clear , atmosphere pure enough , cold great , 12° zero ; , wind gone , temperature unbearable . ten men mounted sides _nautilus_ , armed pickaxes break ice around vessel , soon free . operation quickly performed , fresh ice still thin . went . usual reservoirs filled newly-liberated water , _nautilus_ soon descended . taken place conseil saloon ; open window could see lower beds southern ocean . thermometer went , needle compass deviated dial . 900 feet , captain nemo foreseen , floating beneath undulating bottom iceberg . _nautilus_ went lower still—it went depth four hundred fathoms . temperature water surface showed twelve degrees , ten ; gained two . need say temperature _nautilus_ raised heating apparatus much higher degree ; every manœuvre accomplished wonderful precision . “ shall pass , please , sir , ” said conseil . “ believe shall , ” said , tone firm conviction . open sea , _nautilus_ taken course direct pole , without leaving fifty-second meridian . 67° 30′ 90 deg. , twenty-two degrees half latitude remained travel ; , five hundred leagues . _nautilus_ kept mean speed twenty-six miles hour—the speed express train . kept , forty hours reach pole . part night novelty situation kept us window . sea lit electric lantern ; deserted ; fishes sojourn imprisoned waters ; found passage take antarctic ocean open polar sea . pace rapid ; could feel quivering long steel body . two morning took hours ’ repose , conseil . crossing waist meet captain nemo : supposed pilot ’ cage . next morning , 19th march , took post saloon . electric log told speed _nautilus_ slackened . going towards surface ; prudently emptying reservoirs slowly . heart beat fast . going emerge regain open polar atmosphere ? ! shock told _nautilus_ struck bottom iceberg , still thick , judging deadened sound . deed “ struck , ” use sea expression , inverse sense , thousand feet deep . would give three thousand feet ice us ; one thousand water-mark . iceberg higher borders—not reassuring fact . several times day _nautilus_ tried , every time struck wall lay like ceiling . sometimes met 900 yards , 200 rose surface . twice height _nautilus_ gone waves . carefully noted different depths , thus obtained submarine profile chain developed water . night change taken place situation . still ice four five hundred yards depth ! evidently diminishing , , still , thickness us surface ocean ! eight . according daily custom board _nautilus_ , air renewed four hours ago ; suffer much , although captain nemo yet made demand upon reserve oxygen . sleep painful night ; hope fear besieged turns : rose several times . groping _nautilus_ continued . three morning , noticed lower surface iceberg fifty feet deep . one hundred fifty feet separated us surface waters . iceberg degrees becoming ice-field , mountain plain . eyes never left manometer . still rising diagonally surface , sparkled electric rays . iceberg stretching beneath lengthening slopes ; mile mile getting thinner . length , six morning memorable day , 19th march , door saloon opened , captain nemo appeared . “ sea open ! ! ” said . chapter xiv south pole rushed platform . yes ! open sea , scattered pieces ice moving icebergs—a long stretch sea ; world birds air , myriads fishes waters , varied intense blue olive green , according bottom . thermometer marked 3° c. zero . comparatively spring , shut behind iceberg , whose lengthened mass dimly seen northern horizon . “ pole ? ” asked captain , beating heart . “ know , ” replied . “ noon take bearings. ” “ sun show fog ? ” said , looking leaden sky . “ however little shows , enough , ” replied captain . ten miles south solitary island rose height one hundred four yards . made , carefully , sea might strewn banks . one hour afterwards reached , two hours later made round . measured four five miles circumference . narrow canal separated considerable stretch land , perhaps continent , could see limits . existence land seemed give colour maury ’ theory . ingenious american remarked , south pole sixtieth parallel , sea covered floating ice enormous size , never met north atlantic . fact drawn conclusion antarctic circle encloses considerable continents , icebergs form open sea , coasts . according calculations , mass ice surrounding southern pole forms vast cap , circumference must , least , 2,500 miles . _nautilus_ , fear running aground , stopped three cable-lengths strand reared superb heap rocks . boat launched ; captain , two men , bearing instruments , conseil , . ten morning . seen ned land . doubtless canadian wish admit presence south pole . strokes oar brought us sand , ran ashore . conseil going jump land , held back . “ sir , ” said captain nemo , “ belongs honour first setting foot land. ” “ yes , sir , ” said captain , “ hesitate tread south pole , , time , human left trace there. ” saying , jumped lightly sand . heart beat emotion . climbed rock , sloping little promontory , , arms crossed , mute motionless , eager look , seemed take possession southern regions . five minutes passed ecstasy , turned us . “ like , sir. ” landed , followed conseil , leaving two men boat . long way soil composed reddish sandy stone , something like crushed brick , scoriae , streams lava , pumice-stones . one could mistake volcanic origin . parts , slight curls smoke emitted sulphurous smell , proving internal fires lost nothing expansive powers , though , climbed high acclivity , could see volcano radius several miles . know antarctic countries , james ross found two craters , erebus terror , full activity , 167th meridian , latitude 77° 32′ . vegetation desolate continent seemed much restricted . lichens lay upon black rocks ; microscopic plants , rudimentary diatomas , kind cells placed two quartz shells ; long purple scarlet weed , supported little swimming bladders , breaking waves brought shore . constituted meagre flora region . shore strewn molluscs , little mussels , limpets . also saw myriads northern clios , one-and-a-quarter inches long , whale would swallow whole world mouthful ;
