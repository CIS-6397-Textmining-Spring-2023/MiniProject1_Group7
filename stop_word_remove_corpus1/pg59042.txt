deal fascination skilful operator . class business called option dealing , although practised nearly extent ordinary speculative buying selling , perhaps intricacies , fact full fascination attracts many staunch votaries . jobbers market lay specially option business . options three kinds . case put option , operator buys right sell much stock certain day certain price ; case call option , operator buys right buy much stock certain day certain price ; case double option , put-and-call option , operator buys right either buy sell much stock certain day certain price . instance , let us suppose operator believes price consols , moment 91 , justified . thinks fall . decides indulge put option . buys right sell £10,000 worth stock end next month present price 73 . believing fallen time , sees chance buying less making profit selling 73 . option , right sell , would probably pay 10_s._ per cent . end next month , option declared , consols fallen 71 , obtain £10,000 worth £7,100 , exercise option sell £7,300 , thus making profit £200 less £50 paid option broker's commission £12 10_s._ utmost could lose transaction would £50 plus commission paid option , would , course , exercised price movement produce profit . however much stock might risen , could lose £50 plus commission . belief consols would fall sold ordinary bear , taking advantage option system , would , course , limit possible loss , would measured extent rise stock . risen 2 instead fallen 2 , would lost , £50 , £200 besides expenses . brief outline operation put option , quite easy grasp occurs case call option . matter fact , call options much frequently entered upon public put options , reason public far frequently bulls bears . perhaps optimism human nature accounts , perhaps fact buy natural sell , especially operator got nothing sell . whatever may explanation , frequently bulls regard horror anything nature bear transaction . buy want without turning hair , whilst denouncing speculator , dangerous community , one sells got . may exercise judgment selecting stocks shares rise , consider heinous select likely fall . fact , minds selection tantamount knocking price , severe loss hold securities . always hearing wicked bears , never wicked bulls . hazy kind way , indeed , bull optimism supposed perform public service . ideas perhaps sound , events natural . , however , subject metaphysician ; suffices remark bull operators popular bear operators , call options popular put options . case call option , one buys thinks price rise , reason purchases right buy stock existing price time hence . right , option period expires , sell stock higher price call . wrong , stock falls , sacrifice money paid call option . however far may fallen , loses . case option put-and-call , operator buys right either sell buy certain amount stock certain price certain future date . options generally arranged stocks widely fluctuating nature , operation partakes gamble , mere betting upon chance , either put options call options . cases operator least opinion belief upon lays money : one case thinks stock fall , case rise . case put-and-call , opinion move somehow ; know care way moves , provided moves far enough show profit amount paid option . question involved whether price move widely enough . , consols 73 , pays 1 per cent . put-and-call option £10,000 end next month rise 2 , sell £7,500 ; exercise call , , price paid option , cost £7,400 ; pocket profit £100 less commission £12 10_s._ pays broker . option period consols fall 2 , exercises part option enables put upon jobber , pockets similar profit less similar commission pays broker . consols period option move sufficiently either way make profitable exercise double option , loses £100 paid broker 's commission . price operator option buy sell end option period price stock stands time option bought . course , special arrangements may sometimes made , rule . case , price payable option call always exactly price option put , price put-and-call option always double amount . first sight might appear strange . jobber , confronted name one stock , might imagined demanding much higher price call put , opinion price rise . matter fact , however , jobber really opinion , price stock would immediately put . words , current prices exact expression market opinion . reason jobber make price call option one stock higher price put option going market buying heavily . , price would rise ; thinks price fair level , fair level , likely fall rise . price basis option operation , charges exactly taking chance rising falling . reasonable ask jobber make price call option higher price put option ask go buying ; reasonable ask make price put option higher price call option ask go selling . market invariably puts price stock exact level thinks worth , means , market's opinion , likely rise fall , reason price put option call option . determines price option , therefore , likelihood mind one person rising falling , probability moving widely either direction . price payable option stocks fluctuate widely much higher upon steady , moving within narrow limits . instance , whereas 10_s._ per cent . mentioned ordinary price option consols , price option american railroad shares would £4 £5 . price option depends upon extent , nature , fluctuation , naturally affected also duration period option extends . longer period , course , higher price . stock exchange committee recognise bargain , option otherwise , extends two accounts beyond one begun , would mean six weeks ; law stock exchange evidently aiming prompt settlement transactions . fact , however , options longer periods officially recognised means implies carried . options three months quite common , may said periods options entered extend day six months . case day-to-day options , taken granted period ends exactly quarter hour official closing time stock exchange , half past three o'clock . case options periods , taken granted period ends account fall due , rather quarter hour , idea allowing time making final arrangements . option may arranged january , say , end march account , case period would expire quarter one contango day end account , account actually ending one o'clock . time expires , giver money option declare whether exercise . exercises call option , pay money receive shares . exercises put option , deliver shares receive money . except peculiar circumstances , option dealer , taker money option , know , term arrives , whether exercised merely comparing existing market price option price . call likely exercised shares bought much cheaply market , put likely exercised shares sold much higher price market . giver money option may , course , operate , securing profit , , time currency option period . , early january , bought call de beers 19 end february , need wait end february sell shares right calling , although , course , obtain delivery shares time . bought option early january , watches market case de beers rise point would make profitable sell view option bought . makes mind price sell , instructs broker , watch market . , early february , de beers rise 20 , thinks go higher , sells , knowing option get 19 end month . , however , mid-february settlement negotiated , operator obviously position sold shares yet position deliver . must carry making-up price . means risen , say 21 , must pay difference price sold . puts position sold 21 , profit exercises option include , £1 per share profit aimed sold , also £1 difference pay intervening settlement . obvious , however , one operates option way must prepared meet differences expenses arise connection settlements intervene time bought sold option time option exercised , called , declared . merely operates within account end option expires , requires capital except money pays option , settlements negotiated , may require considerable capital go . even settlements intervene , operator requires capital meet differences expenses connected settlements ; pay stock buys option ; matter arranged broker handing net amount due operator option declared . broker takes remuneration form commission shares client obtains option , whether exercises . operations options may become exceedingly complicated , adroit operator backed option taking advantage various ways fluctuations market . sometimes buying option arranges called call-of-more put-of-more , really means call put much ; may arrange call put twice three times . may easily imagined existence option dealing sometimes palpable effect upon market quotations , , especially contango day near approach , considerable fluctuations often brought buying selling operators able currency period buy sell stocks advantage . stocks must bought satisfy call options , stocks put upon unwilling purchaser must cleared , transactions naturally affect prices . chapter x wares market seen stock exchange market , wares stocks shares . considerable difference , however , stocks shares , various kinds stocks various kinds shares . may interesting profitable inquire distinctions , examine , fact , detail wares market . stockholder frequently called shareholder even precise , , strictly speaking , terms synonymous ; stocks shares . stock calculated quantity shares number ; stock capital lump , shares capital divided equal parts ; although unit stock usually £100 , quantity , £218 13_s._ 1_d._ worth , , case leading stocks , bought , whilst shares , usually denomination £1 , £5 , £10 , indivisible , dealt multiples nominal value . various kinds securities -- including stocks shares -- conveniently divided three main classes according manner passed owner owner . inscribed stocks , registered securities , securities bearer ; classification adopted stock exchange drawing rules relate settlement bargains , three classes set rules . let us take first class known inscribed stocks , may reasonably , particular class belong premier securities -- consols , british funds , corporation stocks , colonial government securities . holder inscribed stocks may bank receipt , certificate holding ; name inscribed legal owner register kept purpose bank england , bank office . stock , therefore , transferred seller buyer mere delivery documents , documents deliver . illustrate method transferring inscribed stock , let us see consols , instance , passed holder person sold . ticket , form supplied bank england , issued broker acting purchaser , passed way explained describing settlement . case inscribed stock ticket contains additional item -- name address ultimate seller going transfer stock . , course , filled ticket reaches seller 's broker . ticket taken selling broker transfer office bank , particulars copied register . transferor -- identified broker , attends purpose -- representative appointed power attorney , sign register presence clerk bank , witnesses signature , also sign receipt purchase money . receipt sets simply transferor received certain sum , consideration much interest share stock transferred transferee . receipt subsequently handed buying broker client . handing bank receipt buyer stock , , recognised method delivering inscribed stocks -- seller delivers receipt appointed time settling day entitled demand payment purchase price . seen transferring stock way purchaser takes little part ; receipt special note recommending transferees , protection fraud , accept stock signing names register bank . use signature verified future transfer made dividend warrants signed . next class securities , registered stocks shares , far greatest number stock exchange dealings concerned . class included nearly whole securities issued joint stock companies . distinctive features registered security transferable separate conveyance transfer , holder legal title security name registered holder books company . registration holder , company issues certificate evidence title manner described previous chapter . stocks neither inscribed registered frequently take form bonds bearer . large number foreign loans issued form , also large number stocks american railroads . bonds bearer pass hand hand exchange money manner bank-notes . convenient form security , , time , somewhat dangerous , case loss destruction holder , course , means proving rightful owner . resemble bank-notes , differ fact currency recognised narrow circle , , course , bear interest . government company issues means knowing whose hands bonds may moment , therefore remit interest payments become due . left holder apply payments , presenting one large number coupons attached bond , bearing date one payment . besides coupons often attached bond '' talon , '' enabling holder demand fresh set coupons supply due course exhausted . although , purposes stock exchange dealing settlement , securities may thus divided three great divisions , point view dealer market outside investor speculator , many interesting divisions , dependent , generally speaking , upon nature rank security . top list come trustee stocks , securities law land permits trustee invest moneys holds trust without incurring liability loss may occur . roughly speaking , include government securities united kingdom india ; certain colonial government securities ; stocks banks england ireland ; london corporation county stocks ; inscribed stock borough county population exceeding 50,000 ; stocks british railway companies ranking ordinary stocks , provided dividend 3 per cent . paid ordinary stock least ten years ; various indian railway stocks , interest guaranteed secretary state ; stocks water companies ranking front ordinary stock , provided stock received dividend less 5 per cent . least ten years ; . , course , may regarded securities highest class -- termed gilt-edged investments . ranking next , perhaps , first debenture stocks railway companies come within trustee act . statement naturally general . debenture stocks industrial mining companies far less sound secure shares lowest rank well-established undertakings . mortgage debentures debentures carry right mortgage , , case many companies , mortgage debentures various classes , one class carrying first mortgage , another second , . mortgage debentures secured specific charge certain properties definitely scheduled , case default interest payment court appoint receiver respect properties protection mortgage debenture holders . debentures mortgage debentures secured floating charge properties assets company , case default rank ordinary creditors , entitled proceed company levy execution . mortgage debenture debenture stocks company frequently described fixed charge stocks , interest never vary rate , paid whatever profits company . fact , debenture holders , creditors shareholders , receive interest dividend . debenture stocks , like loans issued governments municipal corporations , may redeemable specified date . approach redemption date naturally affects market price . stock present quoted 95 redeemable ten years hence 100 , tendency price , course , rise 100 , one buys stock 95 , calculating yield , takes account , course , annual interest , fact must receive , , bonus £5 company buys stock date redemption . similarly , stock bought higher price redeemable future date , buyer must regard yield gives much less , date arrives must take stock less gave . stocks irredeemable , means , course , go bearing rate interest ever . holder stock may sell thus get rid arrangement , company corporation saddled debt obligation paying fixed rate interest upon time . may prove inconvenient unprofitable borrower obtain loans lower rate , way get rid burden make arrangement acceptable stockholders . certain government stocks redeemable comparatively early date , consols redeemable 1923 , option government . although debentures called fixed charge stocks , partly rate interest fixed , partly charge income company consideration entered profits divided among shareholders , rate dividend certain classes mere shares rank debentures also fixed . company may issue 4 per cent . 5 per cent . preference shares , claim upon profits , name implies , preferential ordinary shares , rank . must receive 4 per cent . 5 per cent. , case may , profits , ordinary shareholders look dividend profits remain . time , whereas debenture holders entitled interest right , may proceed legally debt , shareholders , even preference shareholders , go without dividend profits -- end . many preference shares , however , cumulative preference shares , means profits year insufficient provide dividend , stipulated rate must made succeeding profits ordinary shareholders receive anything . case preference shares cumulative , year complete . may entitled 4 per cent. , profits year suffice pay 3 per cent. , get . even profits next year good enable payment full 4 per cent . dividend preference shares , 2 per cent . even 5 per cent . ordinary shares , preference shares receive 4 per cent. , cumulative . cumulative , would receive 5 per cent . make 1 per cent . lacking preceding year , ordinary dividend would reduced accordingly . course , may first , second , third preference shares , cumulative non-cumulative , different series debentures , one ranking another . seen dividend preference shares certain ordinary shares company , time limited , whereas dividend ordinary shares limited profit-earning capacity company . case well-established prosperous concern , therefore , price ordinary shares may much higher price preference shares ranking . company preference shares may receive certain 4 per cent. , ordinary shares may receive 10 per cent. , , although means certain , may certain enough practical purposes . case many companies , course , dividend ordinary shares varies considerably year year , price shares accordingly fluctuates widely . companies , order meet , divided ordinary shares two new classes , one called preferred ordinary , bearing fixed rate dividend , called deferred ordinary , taking remains division . fact , preferred ordinary bears relation deferred ordinary preference shares bear ordinary shares . suppose company paid dividend ordinary shares stock averaging number years 6 per cent . one year may paid 4-1/4 per cent. , another year 8 per cent . ordinary stock fluctuating dividend divided two parts . holder £100 worth stock receives £50 worth preferred ordinary , entitled fixed dividend 6 per cent. , £50 deferred ordinary , entitled remainder . thus year company paid 4-1/4 per cent. , dividend 6 per cent . would paid preferred ordinary dividend 2-1/2 per cent . deferred ordinary -- making average 4-1/4 per cent . whole . year company pays 8 per cent. , preferred ordinary still receives 6 per cent . deferred ordinary 10 per cent . instead stock thus divided , object attained duplication watering . £100 ordinary stock issued nominal £100 preferred ordinary nominal £100 deferred ordinary . case 4-1/4 per cent . dividend , preferred ordinary would receive fixed 3 per cent. , deferred ordinary remaining 1-1/4 per cent . course , stock-splitting stock-watering enables holder original stock dispose , chooses , either speculative stable security . even list government loans , home foreign , trustee

upon ordinary shares . may 100,000 ordinary shares one pound 100 founders ' shares also one pound . may stipulated founders ' shares participate equally ordinary shares latter received 7 per cent . dividend . suppose divisible profits amount £20,000 , ordinary shares take 7 per cent. , amounts £7,000 , remaining £13,000 divided equally ordinary shares founders ' shares . 100,000 ordinary shares receive £6,500 , raising dividend 13-1/2 per cent. , 100 founders ' shares receive £6,500 , making dividend 6,500 per cent . company earned £7,000 , would sufficed pay dividend ordinary shares , founders ' shares would received nothing . objection system evident . directors influence holders founders ' shares , usually , would content earn steady profit £7,000 advantage large number ordinary shareholders , would strain divide large profit one year , even expense making actual loss next . reasons founders ' shares objectionable , especially case finance companies earn profits speculation .
