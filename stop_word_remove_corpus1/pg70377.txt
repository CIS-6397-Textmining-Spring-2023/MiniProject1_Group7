low cost land cheapness material road-bed especially favorable securing advantage ; laws permitted system inflated financiering neutralizes natural adaptations immensely increases cost transportation . railroads largely built borrowed money , construction country afforded opportunity establishing credit relations great lending centres europe , might incalculable value promoting development vast

[ 13 ] footnote 13 : address henry clews , ll.d. , delivered first annual banquet economic club manchester , new hampshire , may 20 , 1908 . _mr . president members economic club_ : political popular clamor industrial trusts , long familiar , due primarily anti-monopoly sentiment people , far greater degree crushing competitors , unlawful unjust methods , conspicuously large corporations , government prosecutions shown . hence public hostility trusts increased , remedial legislation called . general feeling trust neither body kicked soul damned handled law without gloves , utmost rigor . exposure railway rebating evil competition destroyed , great monopolies built resulting colossal fortunes principal owners , added fuel fire indignation ; similar abuses unlawful practices certain trusts showed strong combinations capital preyed upon , killed , weaker ones , individual traders , extent made injustice national scandal . owing inflamed state public mind , laws enacted remedy evils complained may drastic purpose . excesses kind correct . laws either enforced , repealed enforced . general grant said , - “ surest way repeal bad law enforce it. ” fortunately always safety valve public opinion , never errs long run , public opinion nation reflected laws . immensity corporate interests united states suggested fact , including prominent city banks trust companies , 20,000 corporations reported manuals devoted . 1,512 active , operating railway companies , 1,129 electric traction companies , 1,158 gas , electric light electric power companies , 267 water companies , 259 telephone , telegraph cable companies , 1,510 active , operating producing industrial miscellaneous companies , 880 active operating mining companies , 13,500 banking , insurance financial companies . railway companies cover 222,013 miles , capitalization bonded debt , 1st january , 1908 , $ 13,908,456,846 , par . industrial miscellaneous companies date capitalization $ 9,849,833,000 , stocks corporations united states aggregated $ 33,600,000,000 par , exclusive banks , trust companies financial institutions . connection present enormous railway mileage country , interesting note recently 1865 3,085 miles operation ; 1879—the year specie resumption , long civil war suspension 1861—this total increased 86,556 miles . figures remind us great rapidity new railway corporations subsequently organized , laid tracks , old ones extended lines maine california , st. lawrence gulf mexico . also remember nation ’ phenomenal progress simultaneously directions , , 1880 , trust companies industrial corporations far comparison great multitude deal . modern era striking features business life , development industrial trusts cover country , east , west , north south , hardly commenced . yet great corporations , great railway systems still growing multiplying , continue grow multiply meet wants rapidly increasing population generations come , till every part vast territory thickly settled . railways manufactories represent largest corporations , next importance unlimited agricultural resources mining interests . remind us , corporations need regulation law , regulation never hamper , interfere , legitimate activities expansion , however strict severe may prohibiting punishing wilful violations law abuses power . significant power extent railway systems these—fifty-seven all—operate , control , six hundred eighty-eight subsidiaries , jointly controlled railway companies , embracing 196,425 miles road , aggregate outstanding stock $ 4,750,325,000 , $ 8,180,780,000 bonds , total , par , $ 12,931,154,000 . figures exclusive stocks bonds held treasuries companies . thus nearly ninety per cent steam railway mileage united states operated , controlled , fifty-seven systems . remaining ten per cent country ’ railway mileage composed mainly short , independent disconnected lines , run loss , many without reporting considerable profit . railway corporations country therefore , except unimportant ten per cent , great consolidated force , fifty-seven systems control ninety per cent mileage , equivalent many trusts , join hands solid phalanx time lawful purpose , practically form one great railway trust spanning continent , gigantic power law would monopoly . national corporation problem largely one railways , involves best way federal government regulate ,

apprehended result formation trusts occur , least disturbing extent . public hostility quieted , although struggling ruined competitors still felt sore rivals ’ success , discovered making far larger profits ever made industries . always done honestly would reason complain . great industries dominated trusts included , besides petroleum sugar refining , iron steel working , copper metal mineral mining , india rubber tobacco manufacturing , distilling , also many miscellaneous manufactures , addition lines manufacturing . traders occupied fields industry looked small indeed beside new corporation giants . discrimination favor one another railway corporations iniquity built large fortunes starved ruined many . , let us hope , effectually stopped forever exposure denunciation president roosevelt federal legislation provoked ; revival punished utmost rigor law , fines imprisonment giver receiver rebates . fines easily paid large corporations , however much stockholders may suffer , placed behind iron bars always distasteful , terrible , officers ; leaves stigma anxious avoid . aversion disgraced eyes families friends imprisonment criminals always tend make extremely cautious incur risk , however willing lack moral scruples , might violate anti-rebate laws could impunity , however much might aware lawlessness , apart question dishonesty , anarchy , therefore unpatriotic . corporation looting various forms , political contributions corporation money , , like rebating , equally wrong principle , punished equal severity involve compulsory restitution . really way prevent recurrence wrongs unprincipled . judge anderson , charging jury trial john r. walsh chicago bank frauds , said : “ law presumes every man understands foresees natural , legitimate inevitable consequences acts . color act determines complexion intent . intent injure defraud may presumed unlawful act results loss injury proved knowingly committed. ” many irregularities , abuses questionable methods large corporations resulted doubt haphazard speculative manner organized . promoters organizers always , nearly always , speculative objects view forming combinations call trusts . looked first profit stock deals involved , generally willing give extravagant prices , payable stock , properties wished control bring new trusts . , course , caused overcapitalization , many cases overcapitalization equivalent several times actual value properties embraced trusts created , instances many times value . extravagantly high salaries given men control organizations services officers . generally “ make , ” working number one—that themselves—as well trusts . often followed , efforts float stock pay dividends , loose none scrupulous practices resorted , less false exaggerated representations made actual values conditions . greed graft dominated interests outside stockholders . position could help cream , leave skim milk investors , many neglected opportunity skim cream , feather nests less , last years , stricter laws passed congress states management corporations . laxity state federal laws regard corporations , till recently , permitted much done dark , rendered impossible light publicity required new enactments , well various prohibitions dishonest practices , besides crowning evil , railway rebating , prevalent . campaign contributions corporations wrong , morally legally , political contributions wrong , wrongful illegal use corporate money . controlling officers many large corporations , particularly new york city railways large life insurance companies , woefully blind , accustomed handling corporate funds charge owned , could pleased . transactions almost par connected purchase fictitious price certain street railway—a practically non-existent line—in large capitalists concerned . flagrant instance—involving diversion half million dollars—of doings men controlling great street railway system , expense stockholders duty faithfully serve protect . many dishonest acts men controlling corporations gone unpunished greatly regretted , looks much like miscarriage justice . let us believe dishonesty exceptional honesty rule corporate management . punishment inflicted infractions law involving larceny , giving receiving railway rebates . fines terrors wealthy evildoers violate law sinister ends expense others . popular hostility trusts however , often indiscriminate . made little distinction good bad . trusts , enlarged corporations large capital , national trade development time . aiming greater production ,
