advantages disadvantages analyzed accordance determining qualities enumerated , adaptability requirements business surplus private investment discust . ii railroad mortgage bonds railroad bond obligation railroad company ( usually secured mortgage upon railroad property ) runs certain length time certain rate interest . apparent , definition , price railroad bond , distinct value , affected two _accidental conditions_ quite apart five determining qualities described preceding chapter . accidental conditions length time bond run rate interest bears . understand clearly influence accidental conditions matter utmost importance . evident , instance , 5-per-cent fifty-year bond , based given security , sell widely different price 3-1/2-per-cent twenty-year bond , based security ; yet difference accidental conditions control board directors . order eliminate accidental features situation , customary bond-dealers classify bonds purely basis yield , net income return . thorough understanding point essential accurate judgment bond values , whether railroad bonds otherwise , must developed detail , even risk carrying reader familiar ground . bond sells par , yield purchaser net return great rate interest bond bears , two reasons : first , loss principal , represented premium purchaser pays , must distributed number years bond run , operates reduce rate interest holder receives ; , secondly , rate paid par value bond instead actual money invested . thus , 6-percent bond eight years run sells 110-3/4 , yield 4.40 per cent , means holder spends $ 48.73 ( 4.40 per cent $ 1,107.50 ) $ 60 receives annually , spending excess principal , income . conversely , bond sells par , yields rate interest bond bears . yields calculated utmost exactness bonds paying 2 per cent 7 per cent running six months one hundred years , necessary turn tables discover net return upon given bond given price . net return generally known `` basis , '' bonds spoken selling upon 3.80 per cent basis 4.65 per cent basis whatever figure may , reference whatever price rate interest bond bears . indeed , exclusively basis considered bond-dealers often bonds bought sold upon basis price , actual figures bonds change hands determined transaction concluded . expected , course , average business man purchase bonds quite scientific way , essential understand intrinsic value bond determined five general factors described , money value , price , affected also two accidental conditions . exprest words , must realize general factor described _rate income_ mean coupon rate interest bond bears , scientific `` basis , '' derived elimination accidental features . within past year good deal uninformed comment safety railroad bonds . era popular agitation governmental antagonism , railroad bonds enjoyed large measure public confidence ; denied part confidence shaken result recent exposures . even clearheaded men exaggerated importance developments ; often railroad officials , insisted upon soundness stability properties , elected talk publication , given way instead dismal unwarranted forebodings . mystery involved determining safety railroad bonds . man business experience , keeping mind general principle measures value obligations , easily determine , aid two documents , degree safety attaches particular railroad bond . general principle observed safety obligation depends upon margin security excess amount loan ; two documents consulted mortgage trust indenture securing bonds , describes property mortgaged , last annual report railroad , shows financial condition . confining analysis , present , mortgage bonds upon general mileage railroad , following points considered : ( 1 ) _rate per mile bond issued._ applying general principle indicated , must learned proportion bonded debt railroad bears total market value property . much easier make comparison per-mile basis . determining whether rate per mile excessive , reference must made much particular bond question total bonded debt per mile railroad , relation figure bears total market value property per mile . total market value per mile obtained adding market value stock per mile par value bonded debt per mile . single issue bonds varies way $ 5,000 $ 100,000 per mile , according location railroad . total capitalization per mile -- stocks bonds par -- varies proportion , $ 35,000 $ 300,000 . average railroads united states $ 67,936 per mile . actual cost railroad , shown balance-sheet , must taken consideration , also estimated cost duplicating property . physical difficulties construction must weighed , railroad flat , sandy country bonded much , things equal , railroad mountainous country , much cutting , filling , bridging required . section country railroad located must considered , $ 35,000 per mile single-track line poor country may higher $ 300,000 per mile four-track trunk line owns valuable terminals rights way several large cities . ( 2 ) _amount prior lien bonds outstanding per mile._ amount bonds come ahead bond question mileage matter great importance works directly security bond . purchasing bond preceded prior line bond like taking real-estate mortgage property already encumbered . bond followed bonds , margin security property represented wholly market value stock per mile , investor must figure carefully value equity . ( 3 ) _amount junior lien bonds outstanding per mile._ amount bonds come bond question , hand , works directly favor bond , increases margin security . shows also people sufficient confidence property invest money obligations subject one question . event receivership often matter great importance ; foreclosure sale ordered junior bondholders , order protect interest , must buy property amount least equal par value prior lien bonds . foregoing considerations apply particularly safety principal invested railroad bonds ; following points affect safety interest : ( 4 ) _gross earnings per mile._ gross earnings railroad must compared roads occupying field , returns number years must examined determine whether earnings increased decreased . position railroad stands obtaining new traffic must noted . dependent somewhat upon railroad 's ability take traffic railroads , upon probable growth development territory railroad serves , increased traffic probably offered . connection rate increase population road 's territory important . proportion passenger freight earnings , diversity density freight traffic , passenger freight rates examined . reputation management ability integrity considered . gross earnings run $ 3,000 $ 40,000 per mile average $ 10,460 . ( 5 ) _net income per mile._ net income obtained subtracting gross earnings operating expenses ( sometimes taxes ) adding net earnings obtained whatever income sources railroad may derive . important figure . gross earnings , reports examined determine whether net income increase decrease , compared net income railroads occupying field . involves criticism operating expenses . payments railroad must analyzed determine whether proper sums expended maintenance way , replenishment rolling stock , improvements sufficient keep road good physical condition . normally speaking , operating expenses absorb 65 per cent gross earnings . found railroad operates 60 per cent , however , always follow operating officials exceptionally efficient , cost conducting transportation relatively small ; may mean physical condition property neglected , ordinary improvements , charged maintenance , paid increase capitalization . important investor find case . analysis leads suspicion earnings result neglecting property capitalizing every trivial improvement , railroad 's bonds rejected . net income varies $ 1,500 $ 12,000 per mile , average $ 4,702 . ( 6 ) _fixt charges per mile._ fixt charges railroad include interest bonds , rentals , taxes ( last-named reported operating expenses ) . importance figure lies relation net income . railroad earn well double fixt charges , obligations regarded first investment rank . course , railroad earns twice interest requirement upon entire bonded debt , probable underlying bonds protected three , four , five times interest requirement upon , position correspondingly strengthened . foregoing analysis applies particularly mortgage bonds upon general mileage railroad special issues collateral trust , terminal , bridge , guaranteed bonds . necessary , however , lay rules classes bonds , general principles outlined , slight modifications detail , found equally applicable judgment value . equipment bonds , hand , owing want similarity railroad issues , receive separate treatment later . interest , view present diminished confidence railroad securities , advance certain considerations touching upon safety railroad bonds general . last published report inter-state commerce commission , year 1906 , furnishes interesting testimony subject . table page 60 shows total railroad capital united states year $ 14,570,421,478 , $ 7,766,661,385 , 53.31 per cent , form bonded debt , rest capital stock . figures indicate substantial equity , somewhat misleading refer par value . fair estimate market value stock equity , margin security properties bondholder 's point view , obtained table page 82 , shows balance available dividends , paying operating expenses fixt charges , railroads united states year ended june 30 , 1906 , $ 457,060,326 . amount equivalent nearly 7 per cent upon total par value stocks . estimating railroad stock earn 10 per cent upon market price -- even prejudiced admit stock earning 10 per cent worth par -- total market value american railroad stocks would $ 4,570,603,260 , half par value bonds . words , bonded debt would represent something less 63 per cent total market value property . compares favorably security first mortgages upon real estate . safety interest considered , showing made equally strong . page 82 report quoted shows net income railroads united states year ended june 30 , 1906 , payment operating expenses , $ 848,836,771 , total fixt charges , including interest bonds , interest current liabilities , taxes , amounted $ 391,776,445 , leaving balance available dividends $ 457,060,326 . apparent , therefore , net earnings railroads united states , considered one system , could cut half without affecting payment interest upon railroad 's obligations . affords large measure protection . following analysis shows actual market value railroads probably greater estimate made . table shows percentage bonded debt total market

value property , cases pennsylvania , great northern , union pacific , _more half present market value property could erased lien bonds least well secured would impaired_ . course , entire bonded debt protected margin , evident underlying bonds ( prior liens first mortgages ) protected several times great margin position correspondingly strengthened . foregoing analysis , judgment writer , affords convincing proof prevailing want confidence railroad obligations without foundation , railroad bonds compare favorably point safety form investment . remains point amount income degree convertibility afford extent appreciation value promise . impossible indicate general characteristics railroad bonds particulars . railroad bonds cover wide range income return . yield way 3-3/4 per cent 9 per cent , general average 4 per cent 6 per cent . class yield government municipal bonds , less public-utility industrial bonds . equal security probably yield less real-estate mortgages . compared stocks return bank stocks , average railroad stocks , yield less public-utility , industrial , mining stocks . comparisons intended apply classes whole , remain generally true spite specific cases contrary . convertibility distinguishing mark railroad bonds . generally speaking may easily marketed class bonds . compared stocks exceed public-utility , mining , bank stocks point convertibility , yield railroad stocks . hard say whether possess greater convertibility industrial stocks , probable , allowing fact undue impression created activity certain prominent shares . railroad bonds class possess great promise appreciation value . american railroads , generally speaking , adopted conservative policy putting considerable part annual earnings back property form improvements . extent policy followed , equity created back bonds raises intrinsic value . policy contrasts favorably general practise english roads pay earnings dividends , capitalize improvements . addition , new capital american railroads largely raised stock issues , increases margin security bondholders . taken together facts insure steady enhancement intrinsic value railroad bonds , bound reflected , things equal , higher prices . shall attempt discuss time degree stability market price railroad bonds enjoy . explained first chapter , stability market price dependent upon general financial business conditions . sufficient point maintenance intact principal sum invested rendered certain purchase short-time securities whose near approach maturity keep price close par . later chapter general principles determine question elucidated . ideal investment may defined one combining ample security principal interest , good rate income , ready convertibility cash , reasonable promise appreciation value . measured requirements definition , conclusion seems justified well-selected railroad bonds , purchased favorable money-market conditions , afford highly desirable form investment . iii railroad equipment bonds name implies , equipment bond one issued railroad provide funds pay new rolling stock -- cars locomotives . issues variously described car trust certificates , equipment bonds , equipment notes . conform general one two standard forms : ( 1 ) conditional sale plan : accordance specifications furnished railroad , trustee selected ( usually trust company ) contracts builders purchase equipment . 10 20 per cent cost equipment paid cash railroad rest represented equipment bonds . bonds direct obligation railroad company . secured first lien upon entire equipment purchased . title equipment remains trustee benefit bondholders last bond paid , circumstances general mortgages railroad attach first lien equipment ahead car trust obligations . final payment , trustee assigns title railroad company , thereupon becomes owner fee equipment . terms deed trust railroad always obliged keep equipment fully insured , good order complete repair , replace equipment may become worn , lost , destroyed . bonds usually issued coupon form , $ 1,000 , bearing semiannual interest , provision registration . generally paid semiannual annual instalments substantially equal amounts , last instalment usually falling due ten years , period well within life equipment estimated master car builder 's rules . occasionally method payment altered substitution sinking fund , bonds uniform fixt maturity , subject operation sinking fund sufficient retire entire issue well within life equipment . either case security , ample outset , increases proportionally reduction obligations outstanding . ( 2 ) so-called `` philadelphia plan . '' plan equipment purchased individual , association , corporation leases equipment railroad term years rental equivalent interest maturing instalments bonds . contract lease assigned trust company trustee , thereupon issues certificates substantially form described plan , representing beneficial interest equipment , usually guaranteed principal interest railroad . lease runs last bond paid , trustee assigns title railroad . chief advantage plan states , notably pennsylvania , certificates issued accordance terms exempt taxation , whereas conditional sale plan , direct obligation railroad , bonds would taxable . evident foregoing description equipment bonds differ two important respects classes railroad issues . first , title property secures bonds vest railroad ; , secondly , property movable fixt one locality . virtue two points , holders equipment bonds possess great advantage holders mortgage bonds event railroad 's becoming bankrupt . railroad unable meet interest charges , mortgage bondholders rarely better receiver appointed operate railroad interest ; , honest efficient management , railroad made earn interest charges , mortgage bondholders usually consent scaling bonds point railroad operate upon paying basis . holders equipment bonds case quite different . receiver defaults upon bonds direct trustee enter upon possession equipment sell lease railroad . knowledge possess power renders exercise generally unnecessary . equipment railroad essential operation . tool railroad handles business . receiver deprived equipment would impossible operate road , could never satisfy creditors . consequently courts , state federal , ruled necessary equipment bankrupt railroad must preserved , placed charges principal interest equipment obligations upon equality charges wages , materials , operating expenses , priority interest even first-mortgage bonds . points sufficiently explain remarkable record equipment bonds made reorganizations . careful investigation made various railroads reorganized , either without foreclosure , years 1888 1905 . covers chief period railroad receivership . discovered sixteen different railroads , aggregating nearly one hundred thousand miles located widely different parts country , outstanding equipment bonds time default . every case principal interest equipment bonds paid full , securities , exceptions , reduced rate amount . two railroads offered holders equipment bonds option advantageous exchange securities , amounted payment full . foregoing facts justify conclusion equipment bonds possess security equal superior form railroad bonds . let us consider remaining characteristics -- rate income , convertibility , prospect appreciation value , stability market price . one strongest features equipment bonds relatively high rate income yield . amount realized varies accordance financial strength credit issuing railroad , margin security equipment . general rule , net return equipment bonds given railroad usually 1/2 per cent 3/4 per cent greater first-mortgage bonds railroad . owing fact banks scientific investors bought equipment bonds many years , general public sufficiently familiar inherent strength issues create much demand . insures good return . equipment bonds vary point convertibility . reader remember description equipment bonds usually issued serial form , instalments maturing semiannually six months ten years . confining purchases shorter maturities , say within two three years , high degree convertibility may usually obtained short maturities greatly sought banks financial institutions regard equipment bonds much light merchant 's paper time loans secured collateral . price equivalent rate best commercial paper commands , always good demand banks . many banks prefer equipment bonds loans paper account greater convertibility . length maturity increases , degree convertibility generally decreases , chief demand longer dates comes insurance companies , , aggregate , constitute great demand banks . demand private investors increases , undoubtedly become familiar desirable points issues , maturities probably possess ready convertibility . way , equipment bonds vary stability market price . compared classes railroad issues , equipment bonds relatively stable , stability especially marked shorter maturities . equipment bonds possess little prospect appreciation value . attentive reader carefully followed foregoing description equipment bonds , may noticed special adaptability part requirements business surplus . broadly speaking , investment , security required combine perfect safety principal interest , good rate income , ready convertibility cash , unyielding stability market price . necessity insistence upon requirements investment business surplus appear upon moment 's reflection . safety required forms investment , particularly important handling business funds ; good rate income always desirable ; convertibility necessary business surplus reserve funds may converted cash time ; utmost importance security shrink materially quoted price , matter changes may take place financial business conditions , need arise realizing reserve fund , would found unimpaired amount . explained former chapter , point covered selection securities perfectly safe principal interest , purchase short-term obligations . point may illustrated follows : let supposed firm company decided invest $ 100,000 5-per-cent equipment bonds good railroad maturing three years , obtained par , merchant 's paper commanding 5-1/2 per cent . two years becomes necessary firm realize investment time commercial paper floated difficulty 6-1/2-per-cent 7-per-cent basis . money conditions equipment bonds could sold 6-per-cent basis , would mean price 99 5-per-cent bond one year run . firm , liquidating investment , would therefore lose 1 per cent principal , would received 5 per cent interest two years , making net return 4-1/2 per cent . compare showing result bonds originally bought ten years run instead three . two years , firm wished dispose bonds might experience difficulty stringent money market supposed , even succeeded selling upon 6-per-cent basis , would mean price 93-3/4 would represent 6-1/4-per-cent loss principal . necessary sell bonds upon higher basis firm purchased bond ten years run , relative disadvantage longer bond would still apparent . points sufficiently demonstrate importance buying short-term securities investment business surplus . course , money conditions improve instead becoming worse dates purchase sale , greater profit would made longer-term bond . , however , allowed influence choice , first object reserve fund make speculative profit , secondly firm corporation likely want realize upon reserve fund money hard obtain otherwise , precisely time long-term bond would apt show considerable depreciation . foregoing considerations indicate special adaptability part equipment bonds usual requirements business surplus . points brought length importance subject average business man . purpose concentrating attention upon single instance illustrate clearly principles involved time acquaint business man details highly desirable somewhat unfamiliar form security . iv real-estate mortgages preceding chapter discussion railroad bonds brought close . passing consideration real-estate mortgages , next form investment taken , may well review briefly general principles advanced first chapter book , order reader may clearly mind main points upon judgment value investments based . five chief points considered selection forms investment . : ( 1 ) safety principal interest ; ( 2 ) rate income ; ( 3 ) convertibility cash ; ( 4 ) prospect appreciation intrinsic value ; ( 5 ) stability market price . keeping five general factors mind , present chapter discuss real-estate mortgages form investment , adapted requirements private funds business surplus . average american business man familiar real-estate mortgages details may passed briefly . real-estate mortgage , bond mortgage , sometimes called , consists essentially two parts , bond promise pay certain sum money future date interest certain rate per annum , mortgage trust deed transferring title ownership piece real estate , provision transfer shall void interest regularly paid bond redeemed maturity . advancing money security mortgage necessary determine whether title property legally vests maker mortgage ; continuance mortgage necessary proof taxes assessments regularly paid , , case improved property , fire-insurance well . safety real-estate mortgages , common safety obligations , depends upon margin security excess amount loan . case real-estate mortgages amount margin may determined without great difficulty . necessary property carefully appraised expert real-estate values . follow , however , mortgage shown possess substantial equity , perfectly safe investment , unless satisfies also another condition great importance . mortgage may exceed 50 per cent selling value real estate pledged , yet poor investment . point involves serious objection real-estate mortgages sometimes escapes notice . holder mortgage great disadvantage regard changing value real estate . value property upon holds mortgage increases , additional value enhances security loan , add principal invested , value property diminishes , security proportionately lessened , impairment great , holder frequently compelled take property may suffer loss principal . words , receives direct benefit increase value property , stand larger part risk decline value . case investments represented negotiable securities subject changing market quotations . securities , railroad bonds example , acted equally changes value property secures . except influences money-market conditions , railroad bonds advance increase value property decline decrease value . well-selected bonds usually increase value time , increase goes directly benefit holder . failure real-estate mortgages respond similarly changes value property places holder mortgage great disadvantage . owing characteristic , real-estate mortgages purchased general conditions real-estate market distinctly favorable . purchaser mortgage sufficient margin security particular piece property upon loaning money , also satisfied general real-estate values relatively low , undue speculation , conditions favor advance rather decline real-estate prices . class property subject rapid changes value real estate . extensive advance holder mortgage may insufficiently protected equity property , even mortgage represents 60 per cent current appraised value real estate pledged . may 60 per cent loaned represents total value total value years . rapid advance values occurs , tho may largely justified growth development territory , sure present element speculation likely carry prices beyond point reason . turn comes severe collapse takes place , effects extremely disastrous , , unlike speculation stocks commodities , short selling exists real estate temper fall , immobile form capital makes liquidation impossible . considerations serve show need great prudence purchase real-estate mortgages . investor exercises due care particulars , reasonably sure obtaining high-grade security ; neglects precautions , may suffer severe loss principal . general figures available would indicate degree certainty attaching payment interest upon real-estate mortgages . certain classes mortgages , secured unimproved real estate dwellings , afford direct security interest payment threat foreclosure . classes , mortgages upon stores , hotels , office-buildings , often protected large income direct operation mortgaged premises , thus furnishing security annual interest payment . margin protection cases varies greatly , general conclusion drawn . characteristics real-estate mortgages may passed briefly . generally conceded mortgages return higher rate income obtained upon form investment affords equal security . constitutes chief advantage . chief disadvantage , hand , lies entire want convertibility . market real-estate mortgages , except special instances readily sold . fact subject quotation prevents also holding prospect appreciation value . deficiency respect , however , constitutes important advantage another point view . since quoted shrink market price obedience changes financial business conditions . buyer mortgage assured carry mortgage par periods may necessary mark negotiable securities subject changing market quotations . frequently matter great importance . general characteristics real-estate mortgages may summarized follows : ( 1 ) carefully selected purchased favorable conditions , great safety principal interest ; ( 2 ) relatively high return ; ( 3 ) low degree convertibility ; ( 4 ) prospect appreciation value ; ( 5 ) practical certainty maintaining integrity principal invested . security possessing characteristics suitable investment business surplus ? limited extent . safety , high return , assurance loss quoted value principal highly desirable qualities purpose , lack convertibility fatal defect . consideration greater importance investment business surplus high degree convertibility , need arise investment may instantly liquidated . fact real-estate mortgages readily disposed makes practically impossible employ investment business surplus . convertibility essential requirement , want promise appreciation value serious matter , mortgages afford desirable form investment . characteristics possess eminent degree -- safety , high return , assurance loss quoted value principal -- exactly suited ordinary requirements savings-banks . generally speaking , small proportion savings-bank 's assets need kept liquid form readily convertible , accordingly find mortgages highly desirable . purpose private investment attractiveness mortgages easy determine . ordinarily , fluctations quoted values great importance private investor , absence quotation mortgages enjoy especially valuable . safety high return attractive qualities , want convertibility prospect appreciation value drawbacks . whole , private investor may probably employ advantage certain part , much estate mortgage investments . part scientific comprehensive scheme investment , special advantages real-estate mortgages appear prominently years following business depression . period real-estate values usually relatively low , beginning advance , mortgages present maximum margin security . time compare favorably bonds investment securities subject changing quotations , securities apt highest point combined influence restored confidence low money rates usually prevail . several years continued increasing business prosperity positions reversed . discussion real-estate mortgages would complete without allusion guaranteed mortgages placed upon market great quantities within past years . guaranteed mortgages real-estate mortgages guaranteed principal interest substantial companies large capital surplus . addition guaranty , companies usually search guarantee title , see taxes , assessments , insurance paid , perform services real-estate broker . compensation varies somewhat , probably averages 1/2 per cent -- , example , loan 5 per cent sell guaranteed mortgages investor 4-1/2 . value guaranty may considered two points view -- first , event general decline real-estate values , , secondly , fall occurs particular piece property particular locality . severe decline real-estate values takes place , affecting localities , might become necessary holders guaranteed mortgages test value guaranties . case question would arise far capital surplus guaranteeing companies would extend liquidating mortgages guaranteed . would depend entirely upon proportion capital surplus companies total amount outstanding mortgages guaranteed . ordinarily capital surplus exceed 5 per cent mortgages , average guaranty good 5 per cent additional equity . piece property worth $ 100,000 , upon guaranteed mortgage $ 60,000 exists , guaranty would worth $ 3,000 , would margin property $ 57,000 . additional equity little value . probably unlikely 40-per-cent depreciation value take place , guaranty needed unless , occur , depreciation quite likely go 50 per cent stop 43 . second point view value guaranty much greater . distribution risk , case fire-insurance , protects holder loss event fall particular piece property upon holds mortgage , even particular locality . said , however , records yet sufficiently complete form conclusion safe proportion capital surplus outstanding mortgages . guaranteeing companies , generally speaking , operating since inception upon rising market , success hitherto remarkable . allowing drawbacks , however , private investor , unless situated give personal attention details investments , probably well purchase mortgages guaranteed form . v industrial bonds industrial bonds include obligations manufacturing mercantile companies , miscellaneous companies private character . form class quite distinct railroad bonds public-utility bonds . . _safety principal interest._ safety industrial bonds , common safety forms investment , depends upon margin security excess amount obligation . case industrial bonds amount margin always easy determine . even determined , rule difficult application margin may seem insufficient point view physical valuation may satisfactory considered equity working concern . indications relied upon estimating safety industrial bonds follows : ( _a_ ) _value real estate._ first point determined considering purchase industrial bond value real estate upon first mortgage . appraised value ground , irrespective buildings machinery upon , greater substantial sum amount bond issue , obligation practically real-estate mortgage . case , possibly '' slow , '' _i.e._ , secured assets difficult realize upon -- safety bond hardly questioned . judging bond upon real-estate value , always safe take cost price land shown company 's books , frequently cost upon books artificially raised payment made securities whose market value less par , ways . stated , judgment based upon _appraised_ value land . bond meets test satisfactorily , prospective investor may feel reasonably sure safety principal question , may buy bond without anxiety satisfies requirements . hand , bond partially meets test , appears part value comes plant equipment strength company working concern , necessary investor consider carefully several factors . ( _b_ ) _net quick assets._ balance-sheet every industrial company divided horizontally two parts . assets two kinds -- property assets , fixt , current assets , fluid . similarly , liabilities two kinds -- capital liabilities current liabilities . requires extended business experience pick items make totals . plant property assets usually lumped together head , `` cost property . '' current assets include inventories , bills accounts receivable , agents ' balances , marketable securities , cash hand banks -- everything , short , quickly converted cash . side balance-sheet , capital liabilities easily determined . consist par amounts bonds stocks outstanding . current liabilities comprise bills accounts payable , including borrowed money , pay-rolls , interest taxes accrued due . real strength every industrial concern learned figures relating current accounts . property assets capital liabilities significance . cost plant equipment shown books exceeds real value , market usually makes necessary adjustment putting price less par upon bonds stocks . process possible case current accounts . current liabilities exceed current assets company shows deficit , whatever surplus may show books . hand , current assets greater current liabilities , company possesses working capital , represented difference two , known net quick assets . three things consider connection net quick assets : first , proportion current assets current liabilities . put company good shape current assets least twice great current liabilities . two one fair proportion , tho companies show much six one . stronger company proportion better . secondly , proportion net quick assets bonded debt . bonded debt never exceed net quick assets , except company possesses real estate , case two-thirds real-estate value plus net quick assets cover bonds . companies much better . one prominent company country , altho possesses real estate considerable value , agreed indenture securing bonds keep net quick assets times greater substantial margin amount bonds outstanding . thirdly , proportion net quick assets surplus shown balance-sheet . capital liabilities exactly balance property assets , plain surplus exactly balance net quick assets . surplus smaller net quick assets , usually sign capital liabilities created provide working capital . opinions differ wisdom course . generally speaking , better provide working capital means stock issue depend upon banks accommodation . exception rule occurs case companies require great deal working capital part year little times . best banking connections , companies may safe depending upon banks carry , , bonded fixt indebtedness would prevent paper first lien upon entire assets . working capital created issue capital liabilities , much better done stocks bonds . ideal method , however , provide amount working capital organization company necessary conduct business , , volume business grows , accumulate additional amount necessary earnings , refraining payment dividends fund complete . leaving subject net quick assets , well note importance figure showing actual amount current liabilities . company outstanding large amounts bills notes payable , occupies vulnerable position . inability renew maturing notes cause industrial failures last year . ( _c_ ) _net earnings._ amount net earnings great importance estimating strength industrial company . figures number years examined determine whether earnings increasing decreasing , discover whether earning power company stable . depend largely upon nature article company produces trades . product enjoys steady demand fairly uniform price , justifiable capital form bonds ; earnings subject violent fluctations due rapid changes price product , little justification conducting business borrowed money . connection always considered greatly falling gross earnings affect net earnings ; proportion net earnings fixt charges carefully noted . order industrial bond receive favorable consideration , average yearly net earnings company amount three times annual bond interest , taxes , sinking funds . greater protection respect better . ( _d_ ) _form issue._ form industrial bond issued matter importance . principal bond become due number years , danger property depreciate far value leave bond without sufficient margin protection . two ways overcome difficulty . one way establish sinking-fund retire certain proportion bonds lot year . another way issue bonds serial form , definite instalment maturing every year . either case annual sinking-fund annual instalment greater probable depreciation margin security constantly increasing . ( _e_ ) _management control._ question greater importance estimating strength industrial company reputation men charge . ability integrity men control policy company efficiency operating officials principal factors success industrial undertaking . vacillating policies , weakly executed , ruin promising enterprise . particularly true case small companies . every man business experience understand importance factor guided selection industrial securities . based upon foregoing considerations interest inquire degree safety really attaches average industrial bond ? far meet foregoing requirements ? question difficult answer . industrial bonds vary greatly point safety , issues possessing great strength others highly speculative . general conclusions depended upon , investor forced consider issue upon merits . ii . _rate income._ average net return upon industrial bonds probably higher upon form funded corporate obligation . constitutes one chief advantages industrial bonds . iii . _convertibility._ impossible make general statement regard convertibility industrial bonds . industrial bonds , notably larger issues well-known trusts , command broad active market . bonds sold large amounts almost time without seriously affecting price . hand , small underlying issues companies , usually high-grade point security , obligations smaller companies , almost unmarketable real-estate mortgages . two extremes varieties industrial bonds found . degree convertibility security possesses usually matter importance , investor make careful examination bond respect . iv . _prospect appreciation value._ extent bond may improve security time investor holds little importance unless improvement reflected market price bond . investor take advantage appreciation value . order improvement security reflected market price thus add principal invested , necessary bond possess fairly active market . reason industrial bonds hold greatest promise appreciation value larger , speculative issues , possess greatest convertibility . purchase bonds frequently results substantial profits . v. _stability market price._ four points touched upon -- safety , rate income , convertibility , likelihood improvement intrinsic value -- inherent characteristics every bond . likelihood favorable unfavorable fluctation market price largely external nature depends upon general financial business conditions . class , industrial bonds said possess much stability market price . smaller issues enjoy fictitious stability inactivity , generally speaking industrial bonds subject wide fluctations accordance changes business outlook . foregoing summary , necessarily brief imperfect , main points considered judging value industrial bonds . question remains whether securities desirable investment business surplus private funds . except special cases industrial bonds suitable business surplus . impossible find industrial bond combines characteristics necessary purpose . requirements great safety principal interest , relatively high return , ready convertibility , stability market price . many industrial bonds found combine two requirements , even combine three , full combination , exists , unknown writer . addition , principle distribution risk prevent one industrial company investing reserve funds securities another industrial company . private investment case somewhat different . man good business judgment , desires obtain high yield prepared sacrifice something way convertibility prospect appreciation value , may buy underlying issues strong companies every confidence safety principal . , investor wants high yield quick convertibility , prepared take business man 's risk sacrifice stability market price , may make large profit buying second-grade industrial bonds . investor , however , deceive idea industrial bond satisfy requirements ideal investment . vi public-utility bonds common saying among bond-dealers years ago day municipal bond passed , day railroad bond passing , day public-utility bond . municipal bonds selling fancy prices consequence low rates money prevailed , railroad bonds appeared following wake . public-utility bonds alone afforded satisfactory yield , felt investing public would forced turn . prediction , like many others based upon assumption continued ease money , destined unfulfilled . almost immediately appeared added demand capital , face demand , supplies capital seemed ample became suddenly scarce . money rates rose rapidly necessary consequence municipal railroad bonds fell price point net return commensurate obtained loaning free capital . investment situation thus completely reversed . longer question form security investors must seek order obtain satisfactory yield , rather could highest grade municipal railroad bonds floated price . circumstances contemplated necessity turning public-utility bonds never arose , general investing public remains part unfamiliar elements strength weakness . term `` public-utility company '' denotes private corporation supplying public needs authority public franchise . franchise may definite date perpetual , may partial exclusive . public-utility companies include street-railway , gas , electric-light power , water companies . properly speaking , telephone companies also included , usually regarded belonging class public-service corporations . impossible , within limits single chapter , discuss kind company separately . investment value street-railway bonds considered , felt general principles advanced , slight modifications detail , found equally applicable judgment forms public-service securities . . _safety principal interest._ order determine safety street-railway company 's bonds , company must subjected threefold examination , physical , financial , political . examination must made extent condition physical property order ascertain whether bonded debt secured property real market value excess face amount bonds issued . first point determined extent valuation company 's real estate . appraised value land upon power-houses car-barns erected alone greater amount bonds outstanding , investigation need go , bonds , case , would practically real-estate mortgage . instances , however , far case ; careful appraisal real estate necessary make careful valuation physical property ; namely , power-plants , depots , car-sheds , roadway , equipment . usually impossible average investor make examination , likely would possess sufficient technical knowledge render investigation much value . accurate estimate value street-railway 's physical property , usually necessary depend upon expert opinion trained engineer . matter regret average street-railway report relied upon furnish accurate valuation physical property ; accordingly customary careful bond-dealers , contemplate taking issue street-railway bonds distribution among clients , property examined competent engineer , whose report determines question taking issue . disregarding figures show cost property equipment upon company 's books , engineer proceeds make careful estimate replacement value property , including real estate . result examination shows property could duplicated amount bond issue , company occupies unusually strong position -- altho even case part value bonds comes strength company going concern . cases , however , probably found bond issue excess value real estate replacement value physical property , balance representing capitalization franchise . determine real value franchise franchises difficult matter involves whole question company's relations community serves local lawmaking bodies . first question arises whether franchise perpetual definite time , second whether partial exclusive . franchises vary greatly respects . sometimes franchise , apparently partial , practically exclusive , owing fact available space streets already occupied company 's tracks . franchises company limited time , expedient , imperative , bonds mature expiration franchises . company whose bonds examination satisfactorily passes physical test -- possesses real estate considerable value , replacement value property great nearly great amount bonds , franchises , perhaps perpetual exclusive , yet longer duration bonds render successful competition unlikely -- next step may taken ; say , examination company 's financial condition earning capacity may made . amount gross earnings examined figures scrutinized number years back discover whether earnings increasing decreasing . position company stands obtaining new traffic must noted , estimate must made stability earning power . connection relations company public great importance . must learned whether company follows policy conciliating ignoring public sentiment . net earnings company must examined . involves criticism operating expenses . payments road must analyzed determine whether proper amounts expended renewal track , replenishment rolling stock , improvement sufficient keep property good physical condition . intricate subject investigation street-railway property . unless proper allowance made depreciation , addition expenses direct operation , question time strongest company become bankrupt . deterioration plant equipment , goes constantly , offset two ways : one earnings security-holders -- , decreases market value securities . first takes prosperity courage ; second leads bankruptcy . difficult measure depreciation accurately , safe rule write ten per cent gross earnings month depreciation . way charge depreciation proportionate traffic , provides automatic adjustment . net earnings , making allowance depreciation , providing expenses operation including ordinary repairs , amount much twice interest charges upon bonds outstanding , probable bonds may taken safety . finally determining question , however , certain political factors must taken consideration . relations company leaders dominant political party must investigated . likelihood agitation looking toward reduction fares must considered possibility increase taxes ( legal limit ) must weighed . probable attitude legislature question renewing franchises expire must considered . general , must learned whether real ground contention exists company one hand public representatives , inevitable company weaken independence position close connection politics , physical property suffer lack uninterrupted attention . finally one thing investigated -- amount accident account proportion net earnings company . small lines single case heavy damages sometimes make serious inroads upon earnings . foregoing summary , necessarily brief imperfect , true essential outlines , main points considered judging safety street-railway bonds . question remains , far average street-railway company satisfy requirements ? broadly speaking , street-railway bonds yet classed first rank investment securities . troubles come head financial operations traction systems new york chicago typical troubles likely occur elsewhere general causes -- overcapitalization first place insufficient allowance depreciation second place . new york chicago crisis hastened open obvious overcapitalization , almost inevitable many independent lines merged one system . trouble , however , apt occur traction systems evil appeared less flagrant outset . advantages electricity horsepower naturally led multiplication electric street lines , system ten fifteen years ago passed beyond experimental stage . new enterprises , speculation ran ahead reality financing built upon oversanguine calculations often difficulty squaring accounts brought face face facts . calculations insufficient allowance made wear tear service ; words , renewal road equipment . years ' test earnings expenses , became evident proper allowance depreciation plant would show heavy deficit income account . cases therefore allowance meager one made . time method bookkeeping proved less disastrous might expected owing rapid growth population business american cities . possible many cases consider enhanced value given franchise growth business offset depreciation tracks equipment . far also plant kept high degree efficiency charging expense repairs operating expenses , absence depreciation account partially offset . progress recent years , however , new factor entering problem promises make situation still serious traction systems . new factor rise prices wages . temporarily influence factor may checked diminished business activity , normal conditions restored , commence act upon railways accumulated effect . cases proposition increase standard street-railway fare five cents offset increased operating expenses would revolutionary proposal could hardly carried . line cost converging upon line receipts proper allowance made depreciation , traction systems country seem facing difficult problem . long run doubted problem met solved way afford justice alike public use cars capitalists made street traction large scale possible , meantime investor desires perfect safety exercise great care discrimination purchases street-railway obligations . ii . _rate income._ general rule , street-railway bonds common obligations public-service corporations sell upon income basis high-grade industrial bonds -- say , normal conditions return considerably railroad municipal bonds . iii . _convertibility._ difficult speak convertibility public-utility bonds class reason differ widely one another respect . general , certainly difficult dispose public-utility bonds railroad bonds . possess sufficient convertibility justify purchase one may need realize quickly holdings . iv . _prospect appreciation value._ public-utility bonds , except issues convertible stock , possess little prospect appreciation value . pointed depreciation properly allowed , difficult securities advance face obstacle . v. _stability market price._ bonds public-service corporations relatively stable railroad bonds earnings subject fluctations occur railroad properties years prosperity years depression . time , pointed stability price largely fictitious , owing comparative inactivity issues . words , quotation may maintained , usually difficult sell large quantity public-service corporation 's bonds period financial disturbance , railroad bonds easily liquidated even sacrifice . question remains , public-utility bonds afford desirable security investment business surplus private funds ? regard former , may said public-utility bonds meet necessary conditions . security doubtful , convertibility small , stability price uncertain . private investment case somewhat different . keeping mind desirability diversifying investments admitting attractiveness investing class property whose earnings comparatively stable , seems clear public-utility bonds dismissed without consideration . company found whose property substantially equal real value bonded debt , whose allowance depreciation ample , whose franchises satisfactory , whose earning capacity large , whose management capable upright , investor justified giving careful consideration issues . unless points found satisfactory , however , investor content form security . years come feared many public-service corporations suffer war discordant elements -- disregard rights public part management socialistic agitation control part community . warring factions reconciled questions issue adjusted fairness security-holders public , investor prudent purchases public-utility obligations . vii municipal bonds previous chapters considered , turn , investment value railroad bonds , real-estate mortgages , industrial bonds , public-utility bonds . desirability different classes security judged accordance general principles laid introductory chapter ; say , class analyzed relation safety , rate income , convertibility , prospect appreciation value stability market price . determining factors must applied judgment government , state , municipal bonds . bonds issued national government , state , municipality based primarily form power taxation , tho bonds usually tax exempt within political unit creates . power taxation unlimited , case national government sovereign states , question ability political unit meet obligation , question becomes entirely one good faith . probable obligations united states government , reason fact per-capita debt country small , wealth country great , good faith american people clearly established , represent highest type security found world . quite possible , therefore , 2-per-cent united states consols would sell case relatively higher price obligations country , denied chief reason causes sell remarkably high price attained fact required national banks security circulation . fact doubtless controlling element market position , accounts special strength removes field private investment . less secure united states bonds obligations sovereign states union . state bonds usually sell upon basis may taken equivalent pure interest , element risk speculation involved . obligations different states sell different prices , accordance market conditions relations supply demand , question equal ability states pay obligations . repudiation state debts occurred history , cases overwhelming majority citizens opposed creation debt time issue , lacked means control situation . instances chiefly found case so-called carpet-bag governments southern states civil war . municipal bonds -- _i.e._ , bonds cities , counties , townships -- indirectly first lien upon taxable property municipality , take precedence every form mortgage judgment lien . lien enforced tax levy meet interest principal , tax levy courts compel rare cases municipality attempts repudiate valid bond . priority tax lien foundation prime position municipal bonds . case rarely occurs bond held valid courts proves uncollectable sufficient taxing power existed bond issued provide redemption . municipality diminishes population taxable property vanishing-point default occur . investor judge likelihood catastrophe particular community , feel sure bond , valid protected sufficient taxing power , secure principal interest municipality issues secure continued existence . following chief points considered investigation municipal bond : ( 1 ) proportion total debt municipality bears assessed valuation property subject taxation . usually maximum rate fixt constitutional provision rarely exceeds 10 per cent . ( 2 ) purpose issue . must proper suitable one . ( 3 ) proceedings bonds issued . proceedings , form bonds , execution , legal details must full compliance law . points found satisfactory , investor may rest content form security greatly safeguarded bond ranks upon substantial equality government state obligations . rate income derived investment municipal bonds varies accordance obligations selected . like forms security , municipal bonds controlled market conditions , price determined relations supply demand , adjustment prevailing money rates . differing moderately one another point safety income return , municipal bonds may divided two distinct classes accordance degree convertibility possess . municipal bonds possess great convertibility ; others almost none . feature chiefly determines activity inactivity municipal issue size importance municipality , together amount bonds outstanding . bonds large important cities , whose outstanding debt reaches considerable proportions , usually possess great activity . constantly traded command broad market dealers willing buy sell blocks prices within fraction 1 per cent apart . hand , bonds counties , townships , small cities usually quite inactive . transactions rarely occur , dealers make market , sold genuine investors . often impossible even quoted . first sight , would appear active municipal bonds would much desirable , inactive municipals possess special advantage active ones enjoy . possess stability market price . true stability value due fact traded quoted , therefore , largely fictitious , nevertheless accomplished useful purpose . enables investor carry inactive municipals cost price upon books periods active market bonds would require marked conformity prevailing market prices . class investment except real-estate mortgages possesses degree quality price stability . many classes buyers -- savings-banks , example -- stability price consideration prime importance . preservation savings-bank 's surplus , indeed , continued solvency institution depend upon maintaining integrity principal invested . savings-bank requires , also , great safety principal interest ; _i.e._ , certainty principal interest instalments paid maturity . needs fair high yield , need place emphasis upon convertibility prospect appreciation value . comparison requirements characteristics inactive municipal bonds discloses striking adaptability part real needs case . consequence , surprizing discover inactive municipals greatly sought savings-banks . desirability inactive municipals savings-bank investment never forcibly illustrated first last january , savings-banks came make annual statements . broadly speaking , doubt saved large quantity inactive municipals real-estate mortgages carried . considerable portion assets consisted railroad bonds active municipals , upon write loss ten fifteen points , solvency would almost certainly impaired . chiefly concerned pages advantages disadvantages different forms investment point view business man , investment business surplus private funds . municipal bonds , either active inactive , conform requirements business surplus ? said . municipal bonds possess either convertibility without stability price stability price without convertibility . qualities necessary business surplus . form municipal security adapted investment business surplus short-term issue active municipal bond . years run , constant approach maturity invest necessary stability price . even case equal safety equal stability price combined higher yield probably found high-grade railroad issue -- either short-term mortgage equipment bond . private investment case somewhat different . enough said preceding chapters impress upon reader importance buying securities accordance real requirements . investor , careful comparison characteristics municipal bonds , either active inactive , necessities , decides closely satisfy requirements municipals form security , hesitate purchase . opinion writer , however , thorough survey field investment generally disclose investor security either railroad corporation field suit requirements well municipal bond time provide greater income . viii stocks passing consideration stocks investments , necessary outset reader clearly mind fundamental difference stocks bonds . distinction drawn introductory chapter , well amplify , even risk carrying reader familiar ground . distinction bonds stocks _promises pay_ _equities_ . bonds , loans collateral , real-estate mortgages represent one 's promise pay sum money future date ; promise valid security ample , holder promise paid money date due . stocks , hand , represent beneficial interest residuary share assets profits working concern payment obligations fixt charges . value residuary share may large small , may increase diminish , case holder share require one , least company , take share hands price paid , , indeed , price . man buys $ 1,000 railroad bond , knows railroad , solvent , pay $ 1,000 cash bond matures , buys share railroad stock chance getting money back , wish , one else want buy share price paid . buys bond becomes creditor company , without voice management , entitled receive principal interest due pain forfeiture security company made trustee insure payment . buys stock , becomes partner business enterprise , exercising proportionate share direction company 's affairs , sharing ratably profits losses . one case buys promise pay equity . distinction , appears plainly marked theory , much obscured recent years influence two factors . country grew size , large corporations -- railroads , example -- required greater capital order provide facilities handling growing business . impossible provide capital wholly means bond issues without destroying proportion bonds stocks , alone could give bondholders protection substantial equity . therefore necessary obtain large part capital required form stock . railway-managers thus confronted difficult problem . imperative obtain capital , impossible dispose sufficient stock basis speculative risk business venture . therefore necessary railway-managers emphasize , far possible , investment character stock , various expedients adopted accomplish purpose . cases preferred stocks created resulted reorganizations , possest first lien upon assets payment obligations , entitled certain stipulated dividend common stock obtained distribution earnings . way railway-managers created compromise security could regarded stock , would thus provide equity bondholders ' point view , , time , one could disposed investors . cases , probably numerous , railway-managers attempted give stock investment value stability income return . good years company earned 10 15 per cent stock , policy pay 5 6 per cent dividends , hold rest surplus fund order means paying dividends next year 2 3 per cent earned . giving stock stability income return hoped expected give stability market price , thus make attractive genuine investors . effect policy unquestionably successful , one another stocks important transportation systems large undertakings passed hands investors . successful adoption policy part railway-managers captains industry one curious effect contemplated originators movement , brings us second influence mentioned tended obscure distinction bonds stocks . case brought courts contention advanced charges railway public-service corporation high , courts appear taken ground stocks bonds classed together order determine aggregate capitalization company , justice injustice contention charges high determined ascertaining whether charges made lower net earnings would still sufficient pay fair return total capital invested . general line reasoning pursued courts , case consolidated gas company new york pennsylvania railroad pennsylvania . effect attitude part courts obscure still greatly real distinction bonds stocks . early yet judge final outcome changed attitude toward stocks , doubted present tendency opinion subject , far large corporations concerned , limit return stocks strictly investment basis , instead leaving stockholders free reap possible profit business venture subject restraints competition . adoption attitude courts matter serious consideration part present prospective stockholders . maximum return stock limited 6 per cent , fair investment basis , charges reduced consumers obtain benefit greater earning power , would appear stockholders occupy undesirable position . possible profits limited , fixt return insured guaranty possible loss , held purchase stock seems attractive . questions , however , doubtless settled long run justice public stockholders , meantime stocks large successful railway industrial corporations , attained certain stability permanence value , entitled consideration investments contemplated . worth lay rules judging investment value stocks , general principles advanced preceding chapters found sufficient judgment values . one class stocks , however , deserves special mention . bank trust-company stocks possess one characteristic higher degree classes stock . owing general practise self-regulated banking institutions distribute one-half earnings dividends credit rest surplus account , steady rise assured book value stock . class stock possesses quite promise appreciation value . bank trust-company stocks especially sought wealthy men , forego something way income return sake increasing amount principal . general characteristics bank stocks great safety , low rate income , limited convertibility , practical certainty appreciation value . present chapter discussion specific forms investments come end . next concluding chapter explain general principles control market movements negotiable securities , endeavor point indications may relied upon determining whether given conditions favorable purchase securities . ix market movements securities question connected investment money important ability judge whether general market conditions favorable purchase securities . learning judge value every form investment , man may still unsuccessful investment money unless acquires also firm grasp upon general principles control price movements securities . meant man needs intimate knowledge technical market conditions whereby estimate temporary fluctations minor importance , rather clearly mind causes operate produce larger swings prices . investor acquires knowledge , enabled take advantage large price movements way materially increase income , , time , avoid carrying upon books securities may cost much current market quotations . recognize indications point beginning pronounced upward swing securities , equally recognize signs indicate movement culminated , liquidate securities bought inception rise transfer short-term issues whose near approach maturity render stable price , allowing downward swing proceed without disturbing . expected , course , average business man able realize completely ideal investment , hoped following analysis give clearer conception principles involved . broadly speaking , market movements negotiable securities controlled two influences , sometimes acting opposition sometimes concert . one influences loaning rate free capital ; general condition business . low rate interest likelihood low rates effect stimulating security prices , banks money-lending institutions forced investment market loan money advantage . conversely , high rate interest prospect high rates effect depressing prices , banking institutions sell securities order lend money released . automatic working process tends produce constant adjustment yields upon free invested capital . money rates low , securities tend advance point return upon greater derived loaning free capital . rates high , securities tend decline point return great . explains influence first factor . factor general condition business . good business conditions , promise good conditions , tend advance security prices , indicate larger earnings stronger financial condition . poor business conditions , unpromising outlook , reverse effect . larger movements security prices always resultant interaction two forces . work together effect irresistible , low interest rates prospect good business conditions occur together , high money rates occur face indicated falling business activity . times classes securities swing together . part , however , money rates business conditions opposed influence , rates low business bad high business good . usually worse business conditions become , easier money grows ; active business becomes , higher money rates rise . effect antagonism controlling causes produce movements different proportions sometimes different directions different classes securities . high-grade bonds may declining , middle-grade bonds remaining stationary , poor bonds advancing , time . serves give irregular appearance security markets , appears justify widely held opinion security prices pure matter guesswork , controlled manipulation special influences . clear conception nature influences always silently work reconciles apparent inconsistencies makes plain general price movements determined laws certain operation laws nature . may illustrated single example . let us assume interest rates low business conditions bad prospect still lower interest rates still unpromising business conditions . effect upon different classes securities ? high-grade bonds , choice municipals , whose safety impaired extent depression business , advance market price influenced almost wholly money rates . interest certain paid , matter business conditions may become , greatly affected reduction earnings , consequently influence low money rates left act practically alone . middle-grade bonds , second-class railroad issues , remain almost stationary , low money rates tending advance price fear decreased earnings tending depress . lowest grade bonds stocks , whose margin security even good times great , probably suffer price fear default interest reduction dividends operate much strongly mere stimulus low interest rates . course , securities clearly separated three classes , shade imperceptibly one another . classification adopted purposes illustration . point concerned merely showing market movements negotiable securities controlled influence certain factors . important question remains considered , viz . : whether effect two influences produce general swings prices may depended upon comparative certainty , , , indications afforded investor commencement culmination movement . answer must combined effect two influences described produce definite regular swings prices , indications define movements difficult follow . general survey history every industrial nation reveals fact business conditions undergo alternate periods prosperity depression extending clearly defined cycles substantially uniform length . tracing usual course interest rates business conditions throughout one cycles , general idea formed way joint influences operate produce price movements . extent course interest rates cause well result changing business conditions , shall attempt estimate , content note carefully general course rates money pursue throughout cycles . immediately financial crisis , usually closes era great business prosperity , money rates become abnormally easy . within months climax crisis , money accumulates enormous volume financial centers . caused great diminution business activity renders unnecessary large part circulating medium formerly required transact greater volume business . extent accumulation money merely reflects redundancy currency distinguished real liquid capital , little effect encouraging resumption business activity . time passes , however , economies operation commence make manifest , especially waste extravagance curtailed , country whole commences accumulate real liquid capital ; say , total production leaves surplus amount consumption . state business feeling pictured , undertaking new business ventures additions existing properties would approved , surplus wealth created finds way bank deposits liquid capital . competitive attempt loan capital time borrowers produces merely nominal interest rates . continues time . gradually confidence returns spirit initiative begins reassert part liquid capital created year diverted fixt forms . enterprising group men develop mine , lay new piece railway , make addition existing undertaking . length time , however , liquid capital country remains unimpaired , continually increasing . time change comes . annual surplus production , tho larger , sufficient provide new undertakings growing optimism demands . interest rates rise moderately response added demand capital . years along , business activity increases success appears plainly wait upon new ventures , demand new capital develop increased facilities new enterprises exceeds annual supply wealth created . prosperity increased , another factor commences assert . spirit economy thrift prevailed throughout years depression gives place extravagance , demand luxuries , unproductive forms expenditure . total production much greater lean years , margin production proportionately great , amount insufficient meet demands upon . supplies liquid capital stored years depression resorted , serve provide new capital additional years . interest rates reflect encroachment upon stored-up capital , rise gives first real warning country 's true position . optimistic business men heed warning . exhausting real capital available country , proceed borrow extensively foreigners government banks -- country national government bank deposits . every step taken induce foreigners part capital resorted . foreigners buy long-term bonds , short-term notes created . foreigners refuse , asked make loans secured new bonds notes . rates interest offered attractive considerable sums usually obtained , pressure business activity continues . finally day reckoning arrives incident , usually unimportant , first suggests lenders money debtors know overextended may able pay loans . attempt collect loans produces financial crisis brings end period prosperity . foregoing description important stages business conditions pass crisis crisis . different cycles vary particular details , agree essential outlines . sometimes special influences work operate shorten prolong cycle . approach crisis retarded inflation currency , excess finds way bank vaults increases volume loanable credit . effect inflation , however , wholly disastrous , addition supply capital fictitious , real , defers day reckoning greater catastrophe . hand , approach crisis greatly hastened wars , conflagrations , agencies destroy capital , attacks upon capital conduct corporate business , attacks tend render capital timid produce effect violent curtailment supply . many influences might become operative , serve show necessity careful consideration factors work true conception condition tendencies business formed . general account given successive phases credit cycle , possible summarize course interest rates course business conditions . money rates become suddenly easy crisis , remain low grow easier period several years , rise continuously next crisis , advancing great rapidity toward close cycle . business conditions remain poor grow worse years crisis . liquidation taking place , prices going , uncertainty outlook causes diminished activity . thereafter , however , conditions improve activity increases fair uniformity reaches high tension period immediately preceding crisis . course interest rates course business conditions may deflected operation special influences , general tendencies substantially outlined . result operation joint factors may traced market movements class security desired . sake simplicity , let us consider effect producing market swings highest grade investment issues lowest grade , affected money rates affected almost wholly business conditions . emerging strain crisis lowest point , high-grade bonds , best municipal railroad issues , advance rapidly interest rates decline , continuing advancing tendency throughout period business depression follows upon heels crisis . business conditions improve , position , perfectly secure , strengthened added stimulus given rise . middle cycle business outlook promising , interest rates sustained material advance , prices high-grade bonds usually highest point . time forward commence decline , spite increasing prosperity country , influence rising money rates . make lowest prices midst crisis , strain upon capital greatest outlook business unpromising . lowest grade bonds , hand ( whose margin security least ) , commence recover materially price , spite influence low money rates hard times follow crisis , influence reduced earnings fear default interest holding check . outlook becomes brighter , advance rapidly continue improve price long yield current money rates . point , difficult determine advance usually well along toward end cycle , reach high point thereafter decline influence growing stringency money . two extremes , every class security found . better ones tend resemble , market movements , course pursued choicest bonds ; poorer ones approximate lowest class . every case , however , unless special influences operate produce variations , market swing given security easily conjectured investor gives careful attention relative weight likely attach determining influence . * * * * * transcriber 's note : spelling remains original except '' qualities emphasied ; investors '' changed '' emphasized '' . end project
