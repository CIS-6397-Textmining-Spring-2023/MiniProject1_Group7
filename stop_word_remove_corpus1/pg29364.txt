covered subject way man knew little nothing could pick book within hours get clear idea foreign exchange works , -- causes bear upon movement , influence money security markets , etc . object little book -- cover ground foreign exchange , way make subject interesting treatment readable comprehensible man without technical knowledge . foreign exchange easy subject understand ; important subjects . , hand , neither complicated abstruse subject many people seem consider -- idea often born look textbooks exchange , formidable pages tabulations , formulas , calculations descriptions . average man little interest intricacies subject . many shrewdest successful exchange bankers new york city , indeed , know less clerks . needed rather clear definite knowledge movement exchange -- moves , read movements , effects movements exert markets . hope something may added general understanding important matters little book offered public . elements foreign exchange chapter foreign exchange brings existence underlying whole business foreign exchange way obligations creditors one country debtors another come settled -- creditor draw draft directly upon debtor upon bank designated . merchant new york sold bill goods merchant london , thus become creditor , say , $ 5,000 . get money , merchant new york , great majority cases , draw sterling draft upon debtor london little £1,000 . draft banker readily enough convert dollars . buying selling discounting countless bills exchange constitute foundation foreign exchange business . international obligations settled creditor draw direct debtor . sometimes gold actually sent payment . sometimes debtor goes banker engaged selling drafts city obligation exists , gets draft sends . vast majority cases payment effected stated -- draft drawn directly buyer goods . john smith london owes money . draw £100 , take draft around bank sell , say , 4.86 , getting check $ 486.00 . money , transaction . obligations continually arising course trade finance firms new york firms london , follows every day new york merchants sterling drafts london anxious sell dollars , vice versa . supply exchange , therefore , varies obligations one country another . merchants new york , instance , sold goods quantity london , great many drafts london drawn offered sale new york exchange market . supply , course apparent , varies . sometimes many drafts sale ; sometimes . great many drafts offering , makers naturally accept lower rate exchange supply light . par exchange two countries price gold unit one expressed money . take england united states . gold unit england pound sterling . price much gold new pound sterling , expressed american money ? $ 4.8665 . amount dollars cents united states assay office buy exactly much gold contained new british pound sterling , sovereign , actual coin called . 4.8665 mint par exchange great britain united states . fact gold new british sovereign ( pound sterling ) worth $ 4.8665 money means proves , however , drafts payable pounds london always bought sold $ 4.8665 per pound . reduce case unit basis , suppose owed one pound london , , finding difficult buy draft send payment , elected send actual gold . amount gold necessary settle debt would cost $ 4.8665 , addition would pay expenses remitting . would cheaper , therefore , pay considerably $ 4.8665 one-pound draft , would probably bid somebody consented sell draft wanted . goes show mint par governs price drafts pounds sterling bought , demand supply controlling factors . exporters shipping merchandise selling foreign exchange shipments lives never even heard mint par exchange . know , exports running large bills great quantity offered , bankers willing pay low rates -- $ 4.83 $ 4.84 , perhaps , commercial bills want sell dollars . conversely , exports running light bills drawn shipments scarce , bankers may willing pay 4.87 4.88 . clear understanding mechanics exchange market necessary clear understanding various forms obligations bring foreign exchange existence . practically bills originate one following causes : 1 . merchandise shipped shipper draws draft buyer bank abroad designated . 2 . securities sold abroad seller drawing buyer purchase price . 3 . foreign money loaned market , operation necessitating drawing drafts lender . 4 . finance-bills drawn , _i.e._ , banker abroad allowing banker draw pounds sterling 60 90 days ' sight order drawer drafts may sell ( dollars ) use proceeds drafts come due paid . 1 . looking sources supply order given , apparent , first , vast amount foreign exchange originates direct export merchandise country . exports period given follows : 1913 $ 2,465,884,000 1912 2,204,322,000 1911 2,049,320,000 1910 1,744,984,000 1909 1,663,011,000 merchandise drawn ; cases buyer abroad chooses rather secure dollar draft american bank send payment . vast majority cases regular course followed seller draws buyer . times , therefore , exchange originating source much plentiful others . last quarter year , instance , cereal cotton crop exports height , exchange comes flooding new york market country , literally hundreds millions dollars . natural effect depress rates -- sometimes point becomes possible use cheaply obtainable exchange buy gold side . following chapter detailed description new york exchange market given , passing , well note whole country 's supply commercial exchange , certain exceptions , focussed new york . chicago , philadelphia , one two large cities carry pretty large business exchange , independent new york , far greater part commercial exchange originating throughout country finds way metropolis . new york situated many banks bankers dealing bills exchange close market always assured . cotton exporter memphis send bills drawn london liverpool broker new york fullest assurance sold bankers highest possible rate exchange anywhere obtainable . 2 . second source supply sale abroad stocks bonds . evident supply bills must vary . times heavy flotations bonds made europe participating largely , times exchange drawn securities placed abroad mounts enormously volume . times london paris berlin buy heavily listed shares every mail finds stock exchange houses drawing millions pounds , marks , francs upon correspondents abroad . times supply bills apt become great . origin bills source , , apt exert important influence rates , often sudden often concentrated comparatively short period time . announcement single big bond issue , often , assured fact large part placed abroad , enough seriously depress exchange market . bankers know shipping abroad bonds begins , large amounts bills drawn offered rates probability driven . announcements issues , well announcements block kind bonds placed abroad foreign syndicate , apt come suddenly often find exchange market unprepared . supply exchange originated thereby , must remembered , confined amount actually drawn bonds sold includes also exchange bankers , anticipation lower rates , hasten draw . exchange market , indeed , sensitive barometer , understand read sorts coming developments . often happens buying selling movements securities foreigners clearly forecasted action exchange market bankers able gain great advantage able foresee . 3 . third great source supply drafts bankers one country draw upon bankers another operation making international loans . mechanism transactions treated greater detail later , without knowledge subject whatever , plain transfer banking capital , say england united states , best effected american house draw upon english bank wants lend money . finely adjusted state foreign exchanges nowadays , loans continually made bankers one country bankers merchants another . little capital transferred goes form gold . london house decides loan , say , $ 100,000 american market . terms arranged , london house cables new york correspondent draw £20,000 , 60 90 days ' sight , case may . new york house , drawn draft , sells exchange market , realizing $ 100,000 , proceeds loan according instructions . arranging loans , seen , means continuous creation large amounts foreign exchange . financial relationships bankers old world developed , come european money put market increasing volume . conditions money , discount , exchange constantly watched opportunity make loans favorable terms , aggregate foreign money loaned times reaches large figures . 1901 europe big amounts money outstanding new york market , 1906 large sums english french capital temporarily placed disposal . summer 1909 records surpassed , american borrowings london paris footing least half billion dollars . loans , running couple months average sometimes paid , often shifted renewed , give rise drawing immense amounts foreign exchange . 4 . drawing so-called `` finance-bills , '' complete description found chapters iv vi , fourth source whence foreign exchange originates . whenever money rates become decidedly higher one great markets others , bankers point requisite facilities credit , arrange bankers markets allow ( bankers point money high ) draw 60 90 days ' sight bills . bills disposed exchange market , dollars realized , loaned whole life bills . advantages dangers operation touched upon , purpose chapter merely set forth clearly sources foreign exchange originates . money decidedly higher new york london immense volume foreign exchange originate source . number firms banks , either branches london correspondents stand close , position draw large amounts finance bills whenever deem profitable expedient . eventually , course , 60 90 day bills come due settled remittances demand exchange , meantime house drew unrestricted use money . market like new york often prime consideration . money rates soaring frequently , banker pay almost commission correspondent abroad demands still come ahead transaction . principal sources foreign exchange originates -- shipments merchandise , sales abroad securities , transfer foreign banking capital side , sale finance-bills . causes less importance -- interest profits american capital invested europe , instance -- responsible existence quantity exchange , great bulk originates one four sources set forth . next chapter effort made show whence arises demand pretty effectually absorbs supply exchange produced year . chapter ii demand bills exchange turning consideration various sources springs demand foreign exchange , appears divided follows : 1 . need exchange pay imports merchandise . 2 . need exchange pay securities ( american foreign ) purchased us europe . 3 . necessity remitting abroad interest dividends huge sums foreign capital invested , money foreigners domiciled country continually sending home . 4 . necessity remitting abroad freight insurance money earned foreign companies . 5 . money cover american tourists ' disbursements expenses wealthy americans living abroad . 6 . need exchange pay maturing foreign short-loans finance-bills . 1 . payment merchandise imported constitutes probably important source demand foreign exchange . merchandise brought country period given herewith valued follows : 1913 $ 1,813,008,000 1912 1,653,264,000 1911 1,527,226,000 1910 1,556,947,000 1909 1,311,920,000 practically whole amount huge importations paid bills exchange . whether merchandise question cutlery manufactured england coffee grown brazil , chances paid ( system described hereafter ) bill exchange drawn london great european financial center . one year 's end constantly demand bills pay merchandise brought country . case exports , largest fall , much demand exchange pay imports certain times year others , times merchandise quantity coming country must paid bills exchange . 2 . second great source demand originates necessity making payment securities purchased abroad . far american participation foreign bond issues concerned , past years seen great developments . yet people , english french , invest large proportion accumulated savings outside country , investment surplus increased size , _has_ come american investors going extensively foreign bonds . times , indeed , japanese loans floated , large amounts foreign exchange required pay bonds taken american individuals syndicates . security operations involving demand foreign exchange , however , means confined american participation foreign bond issues . accumulated course past half century , perfectly immense amount american securities held europe . greater part investment bonds remains untouched years stretch . come times , one reason another , waves selling pass european holdings `` americans , '' required take back millions dollars' worth stocks bonds . selling movements really get far surface -- , instance , disturb great blocks american bonds large proportion many big foreign fortunes invested , apt , nevertheless , scale requires large amounts exchange pay buy back . thing true stocks , though case selling movements frequent less important . europe always interested heavily american stocks , , case bonds , big fixed investment capital , beside continually fluctuating `` floating-investment . '' words , aside fixed investments stocks , foreigners continually speculating continually changing position buyers sellers . selling movements materially affect europe 's set position stocks , result times large amounts stocks dumped back upon us -- sometimes ready , sometimes operation decidedly painful , fall 1907 . case , europe sells , buy . buy , rate millions dollars ' worth day , big demand exchange pay bought . 3 . great foreign investment capital country necessity remitting interest dividends alone means another continuous demand large amounts foreign exchange . estimates much european money invested little better guesses . sure thing figures run well billions several hundred millions dollars' worth interest dividends must sent across water year . , first place , foreign investments might called private enterprise -- english money , instance , invested fruit orchards , gold copper mines , etc. , western states . profits money practically remitted back england , way exists even estimating amount . aside foreign holdings bonds stocks great public corporations , holdings whose ownership impossible trace . interest periods beginning middle year become apparent large proportion bonds held europe great demand exchange make remittances accrued interest . times incoming mails international banking houses bulge great quantities coupons sent collection . several weeks either side two important interest periods , exchange market feels stimulus demand exchange proceeds masses coupons sent abroad . 4 . freights insurance responsible fourth important source demand foreign exchange . walk along william street new york necessary give good idea number importance foreign companies business united states . form premiums paid sent side . times come , course , like year baltimore fire , losses foreign companies greatly outbalance premiums received , business thus resulting actual _creation_ great amounts foreign exchange , long run -- year , year -- remitting abroad premiums earned means steady demand exchange . freights proposition , except proportion american shipping business done foreign companies much greater proportion insurance business done foreign companies . since civil war american mercantile marine instead growing country gone steadily backward , greater part shipping done foreign bottoms . aside disadvantages condition , payment great sums freight foreign companies direct economic drain . estimate yearly freight bill amounts $ 150,000,000 probably high . means course every year demand amount exchange remit back earned us . 5 . tourists ' expenditures abroad responsible heavy demand exchange . whether americans fonder travel people countries whether less isolated position map , fact far americans traveling europe people belonging nation . sums spent american tourists foreign lands annually aggregate large amount -- possibly much $ 175,000,000 -- eventually covered remittances exchange side . must considered expenditures wealthy americans either live abroad entirely else spend large part time side . past decade come every european city consequence `` american colony , '' society longer composed poor art students whose residence abroad matter volition , consisting many wealthiest americans . expatriates money spent extremely freely , drafts london paris requiring frequent replenishment , remittances exchange side , bank balances points . furthermore , must considered great amounts american capital transferred abroad marriage wealthy american women titled foreigners . alliances mean transfer large amounts capital _en bloc_ , mean well , usually , annual remittance large sum money . account money drained country way kept , course , item certainly runs tens millions . 6 . lastly , demand exchange originating paying short-term loans european bankers continuously make american market . never time nowadays london paris lending american bankers less $ 100,000,000 60 90 day bills , total frequently runs three four times amount . sum floating loans , indeed , changing time , circumstance responsible demand great amounts foreign exchange . take , instance , amount french english capital employed market form short-term loans ; $ 250,000,000 probably fair estimate average amount , 90 days fair estimate average time loans run paid renewed . means quarter billion dollars floating indebtedness `` turned '' four times year _that_ means every year rearrangement loans gives rise demand billion dollars ' worth foreign exchange . loaning operations , must understood , originate exchange create demand . mentioned , therefore , preceding chapter , one sources exchange originates , one sources , course every year , springs demand great quantity exchange . six sources demand exchange , , payment imports ; securities purchased abroad ; remitting abroad interest foreign capital invested money foreigners country send home ; remitting freight insurance profits earned foreign companies ; tourists' expenses abroad ; lastly , paying foreign loans . sources spring practically demand exchange . last chapter set forth principal sources supply . clear understanding exchange comes goes , ought possible student subject grasp causes bear movement exchange rates . subject accordingly taken next chapter . chapter iii rise fall exchange rates granted obligations two given countries foot amount , evident rate exchange remain exactly gold par -- new york , instance , price sovereign simply mint value gold contained sovereign . two countries condition exist -- take two , amount obligation one changes every day , causes continuous fluctuation exchange rate -- sometimes mint par , sometimes . going discuss various causes influencing movement exchange rates , one point clearly understood . _two_ countries , least , concerned fluctuation every rate . take , example , london new york , assume , new york , exchange london falling . means , london , exchange new york rising . sake clearness , ensuing discussion influences tending raise lower exchange rates , new york chosen point influences operative . consideration given first influences cause exchange go . general way , noticed , conform sources demand exchange given previous chapter . may classified follows : 1 . large imports , calling large amounts exchange make necessary payments . 2 . large purchases foreign securities us , repurchase securities abroad , calling large amounts exchange make payment . 3 . coming maturity issues american bonds held abroad . 4 . low money rates , result demand exchange send banking capital country . 5 . high money rates foreign centre create great demand exchange drawn centre . 1 . heavy imports always potent factor raising level exchange rates . whatever financial arrangement whatever point merchandise imported united states , payment almost invariably made draft london , paris , berlin . times imports run especially heavy , demand importers exchange often outweighs every consideration , forcing rates high levels . practical illustration found inpour merchandise took place tariff legislation 1909 . convinced duties raised , importers rushed millions dollars' worth merchandise every description country . result demand exchange became great spite fact season exports normally meant low exchange , rates pushed gold export point . 2 . heavy purchasing movements foreign securities , side , second great influence making high exchange . come times , one reason another , movement securities one way , happens cause ones buying , exchange market likely sharply influenced upward demand bills make payments . movements greater less scale go time constitute one principal factors exchange managers take consideration making estimate possible exchange market fluctuations . interesting , instance , note movement foreign exchange times heavy selling movement american stocks foreigners way . origin security-selling stock exchange means easy trace , times character brokers selling nature stocks disposed mean much experienced eye . take , instance , day half dozen brokers usually identified operations international houses consistently selling stocks missouri , kansas & texas , baltimore & ohio , canadian pacific -- whether inference selling foreign account correct probably read movement exchange market . case selling comes abroad _we_ buying , large orders foreign exchange almost certain make appearance give market strong tone actually urge sharply upward . orders likely handled way makes apparent everybody , rule impossible execute without creating condition exchange market apparent every shrewd observer . , matter fact , many operation international stocks based upon judgment action exchange market portends . similarly -- way around -- exchange managers frequently operate exchange strength judge know going happen market international stocks . exchange market sensitive developments , knowledge heavy selling quarter stock market , abroad , almost equivalent knowledge coming sharp rise exchange london . perhaps best illustration exchange affected foreign selling securities occurred beginning panic period october 1907 . continuous withdrawals new york capital foreign markets , exchange sold low point . suddenly came memorable selling movement '' americans '' english german investors . within two three days perhaps million shares american stocks jettisoned market foreigners , exchange rose leaps bounds nearly 10 cents pound , unheard-of price 4.91 . nobody exchange sell almost overnight created demand tens millions dollars ' worth . 3 . coming maturity american bonds held abroad another influencing factor closely kept track dealers exchange . extensive total foreign investment american bonds issues coming due time . especially large issue runs without funded new bonds , demand exchange often becomes strong . especially case short-term issues railroads especially new york city revenue warrants become exceedingly popular form investment among foreign bankers . spite mammoth debt , new york city continually putting revenue warrants , operation amounting , fact , issue notes . late years paris bankers , especially , found discounting `` notes '' profitable operation times taken big blocks . whenever one blocks revenue warrants matures paid , exchange market likely strongly affected . accumulation exchange preparation likely carried weeks ahead , even resulting steady demand bills often exerts decidedly stimulating influence . experienced exchange managers know times short-term issues coming due , proportion bonds notes found way side , far ahead exchange likely accumulated . repayment operations kind often almost dominant , though usually temporary , influence price exchange . 4 . low money rates fourth great factor influencing foreign exchange upward . whenever money cheap given center , borrowers bidding low rates use , lenders seek profitable field employment capital . come past years far operation loaning money concerned , whole financial world one great market , new york bankers nowadays loaning money london facility used loan boston philadelphia . close become financial relationships leading banking houses new york london slightest opportunity profitable loaning operations immediately availed . money rates new york market often less attractive london , american floating capital generally employed english market , occasionally come rates become abnormally low bankers send away balances loaned points . long periods low money , indeed , often happens large lending institutions send away considerable part deposits , steadily employed loaning discounting bills foreign market . time long period stagnant money conditions following 1907 panic . trust companies banks paying interest large deposits time sent large amounts money side kept big balances running correspondents points amsterdam , copenhagen , st. petersburg , etc. , -- anywhere , fact , little demand money actually existed . demand exchange send money abroad big factor keeping exchange rates high level long period . 5 . high money rates given foreign point factor elevating exchange rates point might almost considered corollary low money , special considerations often govern condition make worth note effect . suppose , instance , time money market conditions world normal , rates , given reason , begin rise point , say london . instantly flow capital begins direction . new york , paris , berlin centers realized london bidding better rates money obtainable locally , bankers forthwith make preparations increase sterling balances employing london . exchange particular point demand , rates begin rise , continue rise , according urgency demand . particular attention given later way bank england great foreign banks manipulate money market control course foreign exchange upon , passing well note interest rate given point begins go , foreign exchange drawn upon point begins go , . remittances point better bid money made , simple explanation . bankers want send money , need bills exchange . urgent enough demand inevitably means rise quotation bills obtainable . suggests plainly directors bank england want raise rate exchange upon london , new york paris berlin , go tightening english money market . foregoing principal causes making high exchange . causes make low rates must necessarily certain extent merely converse , sake clearness set . division follows : 1 . especially heavy exports merchandise . 2 . large purchases stocks foreigners placing abroad blocks american bonds . 3 . distrust part financial conditions existing point abroad carried large deposits american capital . 4 . high money rates . 5 . unprofitably low loaning rates important foreign centre american bankers ordinarily carry large balances deposit . 1 . unusually large imports commodities mean sharp demand exchange pay , unusually large exports mean big supply bills . previous chapter explained , merchandise shipped country , shipper draws draft upon buyer , currency country merchandise goes . exports heavy , therefore , great volume bills exchange drawn various kinds currency comes market sale , naturally depressing rates . exports continue certain scale year , , like imports , heavier times others . fall , instance , year 's crops exported , shipments country invariably reach zenith , export nadir approached midsummer , crop mostly exported shipments manufactured goods running light . middle august , first new cotton crop begins find way seaport , middle december , bulk corn wheat crop exports completed , exchange great volume finds way new york market . normally season low rates , reason many shippers cotton grain , know months advance approximately much ship , contract ahead time exchange dealers new york sale bills know . , shippers often able obtain much better rates . protect , least , extremely low rates may forced take wait accept going rates time shippers country trying sell bills time . great rush exchange market may seen statistics cotton exports period given . cotton goes last four months year , greater part , furthermore , cotton , important , _one_ domestic products exported autumn . money value cotton exported 1913 $ 547,357,000 1912 565,849,000 1911 585,318,000 1910 450,447,000 1909 417,390,000 autumn months , normal conditions , advantage buyer foreign exchange . every mail huge packages bills , drawn shipments cotton , wheat corn , come pouring new york market . bankers ' portfolios become crowded bills ; remittances steamer , case big bankers , run , literally , millions dollars . naturally , one wanting bankers ' exchange usually able secure low price . 2 . regard second influence making low exchange , sale american bonds stocks abroad , season set influence likely operative , unless , possibly , spring , money rates apt low bond issues larger time year . time , however , definitely set -- years bulk new issues brought spring years fall season sees new financing . whatever time year , one thing certain -- issue amount american bonds europe participating largely means full supply foreign exchange time issues actually brought , long afterward . used saying among exchange dealers cotton exports make exchange faster anything , nowadays bond sales abroad come take first place . foreign participation syndicates formed underwrite new issues almost invariably means drawing bills representing full amount foreign participation . syndicate formed , instance , take hands x z railroad $ 30,000,000 new bonds , arrangement railroad receive money syndicate take time working bonds . half amount , say , allotted foreign houses . immediately , drawing £3,000,000 , francs 75,000,000 , case may , begins . foreign houses raise money , nine cases ten , way arrange representative abroad let draw long drafts , deposit securities side . drafts , pounds francs , sixty ninety days' sight , sell exchange market dollars , thus securing money agreed turn railroad . meantime , life drafts set afloat come due paid , bankers go selling bonds getting back money . perhaps sixty ninety days , case may , , syndicate may sold bonds foreign members put position pay drafts set afloat originally order raise money . often , however , happen account one reason another , sixty days pass ninety days pass without syndicate able dispose bonds . case long bills drawn foreign bankers `` renewed '' -- process ample provision , course , made . succeeding chapter , full description long bills exchange coming due renewed made . necessary say money necessary pay maturing bills raised selling another batch `` sixties '' `` nineties , '' operation throws maturity two three months ahead . outline way foreign participation american bond issues financed , seen every time big issue bonds railroad industrial european investors actively interested , brought , means large supply foreign exchange created suddenly thrown exchange market sale . suddenly publicly bankers concerned help , still necessarily great degree , big bond issues made full knowledge coöperation large part public . bankers know advance large issues likely made know asked participate , often sell `` futures '' covering exchange foresee participation bring existence , general rule may set heavy issues , involving sale abroad large amounts bonds , depressing factor foreign exchange market . especially , participants agreed turn money railroad , must sell bills raise , even horde speculators `` trailers '' always lookout opportunities , make every effort sell market feet . 3 . uneasiness regard stability financial situation point abroad american bankers usually carry large balances another circumstance often depresses exchange market sharply . `` trouble balkans '' `` trouble moroccan situation '' two bugbears years back furnished keynote many swoops downward exchange market , years book published probably continue . money deposit point several thousand miles away naturally sensitive , least suspicion financial trouble sufficient cause withdrawal . withdrawal bankers ' balances foreign city means offerings exchange drawn point resultant decline rates . everyday life exchange market , political developments unfavorable character war rumors frequent potent influences toward condition uneasiness referred . war rumors ever come anything , times circulate astonishing frequency persistence cause decided uneasiness concerning financial conditions important points . times bankers money deposit points apt become influenced drift sentiment draw balances . , , operators exchange , keenly alert chances , likely begin sell exchange market short often succeed breaking degree entirely unwarranted known facts . 4 . sure depressing influences exchange , none sure rise money market . gradual usually decline caused influence sale american bonds abroad , influence rising level money rates nevertheless far certain . theory `` counter '' movement money rates exchange simply money rates rise , say point like new york , american bankers find profitable draw deposits europe purpose using money new york . process means wholesale drawing bills exchange leading european cities , consequent offering bills price-depression leading american exchange markets . number banks scattered united states keep running deposit accounts leading european cities become surprisingly great past ten years , movement bring home capital go little way reaches large proportions . exactly happens money rates point like new york become decidedly attractive side . arrangements foreign correspondents usually call minimum balance considerable size , must left intact , ordinary circumstances considerable leeway , better opportunity loaning presents , drafts balances abroad , large aggregate amount , apt drawn sold market . especially case cause higher money level appears deep-rooted outlook continuance condition time come . 5 . lastly , depressing factor , considered condition arises money important foreign center , london paris , begins ease decidedly . large receipts gold mines , bettering political outlook -- many causes may bring money london , instance , period high rates , may ease faster berlin hamburg . result , american bankers large balances london finding difficult employ profitably , longer , either withdraw entirely money transferred point . either case operation result depressing rate exchange london , american banker either draw london , wants transfer money berlin hamburg , instruct german bankers cable draw account london . whatever way accomplished , withdrawal capital banking point tends lower rate foreign exchange point . main influences bearing fluctuation exchange . needless say exerted one way , one time , set forth . international money markets decidedly complex proposition , literally never time several influences tending put rates conflicting several influences tending put rates . actual movement rate represents relative strength two sets influences . able `` size '' influences present gauge movement rates result , operation requiring , first , knowledge , judgment . former qualification perhaps derived , small degree , study foregoing pages . latter matter mental calibre experience . chapter iv various kinds exchange taking question activities foreign exchange department question bankers make money dealing exchange , may well fix mind clearly various forms foreign exchange . following description important classes bills bought sold new york market : 1 . _commercial long bills_ [ illustration : form commercial long bill ] drafts drawn shippers merchandise upon buyers abroad , upon banking representatives buyers abroad , thirty days ' sight . drafts may accompanied shipping documents may '' clean . '' former kind bill making greater part whole amount foreign exchange dealt new york market , described first . suppose cotton dealer memphis sold one hundred bales cotton spinner liverpool , arrangement english buyer drawn sixty days ' sight . first thing memphis merchant ship cotton way liverpool , receiving railroad company receipt known '' bill lading . '' time arranges insurance cotton , receiving insurance company little certificate stating insurance effected . next step memphis shipper draw draft liverpool buyer -- upon bank abroad designated buyer . draft drawn pounds sterling equivalent dollar value cotton made payable sixty days party abroad drawn seen written `` accepted '' across face . draft , bill lading received shipping company , insurance certificate received insurance company pinned together constitute complete `` commercial long bill documents attached . '' less important documents go bill . sometimes invoices showing weight price cotton go along sometimes also attached `` hypothecation slip '' formally turns right goods memphis new york banker buys draft accompanying documents memphis cotton shipper . sometimes , , insurance effected buyer abroad , case may insurance certificate . main , one `` documentary '' commercial bills consists draft , bill lading , insurance certificate . pinned document draft together , memphis cotton shipper possession instrument dispose dollars . either selling bank memphis sending new york , order may sold exchange market current rate exchange . say , bill exchange drawn london sixty days ' sight , £1,000 . buying price draft , perhaps , 4.84 . memphis shipper gets check $ 4,840 , transaction . bill passed banker 's hands , send abroad -- deposit foreign bank keeps balance . rate 4.84 received shipper , noted bill drawn less sixty days ' sight , would received dollars , drawn sixty days ' sight , would received less . longer banker takes draft shipper 's hands wait get money back , lower , naturally , rate exchange willing pay . day demand drafts selling 4.87 , sixty-day drafts may selling 4.84 ninety-day drafts 4.83 . assume , particular case , draft taken shipper 's hands foreign exchange banker new york . first steamer latter forward banking correspondent abroad , instructions present parties drawn , order may mark '' accepted -- payable such-and-such-a-date .

'' whether collateral put , whole purpose drawing finance-bills provide easy way raising money without banker go bank . origin ordinary finance-bill follows : bank new york carries good balance london works substantial foreign exchange business connection london bank balance carried . time comes new york banking house could advantageously use money . arrangements therefore made london bank whereby london bank agrees '' accept '' certain amount american banker 's long bills , commission . course regular business , , american banker simply draws many pounds sterling long bills , sells , time use money . great majority cases extra collateral put , london bank especially secured way . american banker 's credit good enough make english banker willing , commission , '' accept '' drafts obligate drafts paid maturity . naturally , house good standing enjoy high credit side reputable london bank induced `` accept '' finance paper . ability draw finance-bills kind often puts house disposed take chances movement exchange market line considerable profit possibilities . suppose , instance , manager house figures going sharp break foreign exchange . , therefore , sells line ninety-day bills , putting technically short exchange market banking chance able buy `` cover '' cheaply comes time cover . meantime use money derived sale `` nineties '' pleases , figured market aright , may cost per pound buy `` cover '' realized sale long bills . case would use money whole three months practically free interest . plain speculating exchange -- getting away , yet practice selling finance-bills gives opportunity exchange manager shrewd enough read situation aright make money , many big houses go large extent . summer , instance , outlook big crops , situation apt commend kind operation . money summer months apt low exchange high , affording good basis sell exchange . , expected crops materialize , large amounts exchange drawn exports come market , forcing rates giving operator previously sold long bills excellent chance cover profitably come due . best example exchange managers deceived forecasts afforded movement exchange summer fall 1909 . impelled thereto brilliant crop prospects early summer , foreign exchange houses new york drew sold finance-bills enormous volume . corn crop run three billion bushels , affording unprecedented exportable surplus -- wheat cotton show record-breaking yields . instead promises fulfilled , wheat corn showed average yields , cotton crop turned decidedly short . expected flood exchange never materialized . contrary , rise money rates abroad caused paying foreign loans maturing finance bills foreign exchange rose gold export point `` covering '' operations conducted extreme difficulty . foreign exchange market autumn 1909 long remembered time finance-bill sellers administered lesson good forgetting . 6 . _arbitraging exchange_ arbitraging exchange -- buying new york banker , instance , medium london market , exchange drawn paris , another broad profitable field operations expert foreign exchange manager . take , example , time exchange paris plentiful london new york -- shrewd new york exchange manager needing draft paris might well secure london rather home city . following operation one ten thousand exchange men continually engaged , representative transaction one good deal business arbitration exchange based . suppose , instance , new york , demand exchange paris quoted five francs seventeen one-half centimes per dollar , demand exchange london $ 4.84 per pound , , _in london_ , exchange paris obtainable twenty-five francs twenty-five centimes per pound . following operation would possible : sale new york banker draft paris , say , francs 25,250 , 5.17-1/2 , bringing $ 4,879.23 . purchase banker draft london £1,000 , 4.84 , costing $ 4,840 . instructions american banker london correspondent buy check paris francs 25,250 london , send paris credit ( american banker 's account ) . draft , 25.25 would cost £1,000 . circle would complete . american banker originally drew francs 25,250 paris balance would replaced amount paris balance aid london correspondent . london correspondent would paid £1,000 american banker 's balance , draft amount would come next mail . parties transaction would satisfied -- especially banker started , whereas paid $ 4,840 £1,000 draft london , originally took $ 4,879.23 draft sold paris . cities used foregoing illustrations rates apt wide enough apart afford actual profit , chance arbitraging exist continuously taken advantage . keenly , indeed , various rates possible relation one another watched exchange men next impossible `` open '' appreciable extent . chance make even slight profit shifting balances quickly availed constant demand exchange wherever relative weakness shown , exists force keeps whole structure parity . ability buy drafts paris relatively much cheaper london new york , instance , would quickly taken advantage half dozen watchful exchange men london rate paris would quickly enough driven right relative position . impossible brief treatise give suggestion various kinds exchange arbitration carried time . experts confine operations main centers , three necessarily largest number points figure transactions sort . elaborate cable codes constant use wires keep up-to-date exchange manager touch movement rates every part europe . chance exists sell draft london put requisite balance arbitration involving paris , brussels , amsterdam , chances shrewd manager find put transaction . larger banking houses employ men little look opportunities . times normal , margin profit small , disturbed markets parities nearly closely maintained substantial profits occasionally made . business , however , difficult character , requiring great shrewdness judgment exceptional mechanical facilities . 7 . _dealing `` futures_ '' means making -- losing -- money , foreign exchange business , dealing contracts future delivery exchange , perhaps , equal . yet trading futures means necessarily speculation . least two broad classes legitimate operation buying selling contracts exchange future delivery plays vital part . take case banker bought remitted foreign correspondent miscellaneous lot foreign exchange made extent one-half , perhaps , commercial long bills documents deliverable ``
