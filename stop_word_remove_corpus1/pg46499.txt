ordinarily , abundance makes utility , use value , small . essential purpose work enter abstract discussion theory value necessary make clear fact present analysis way lessens invalidates distinction two conceptions value noted earlier economists , -- fact overlooked accepted marginal utility theory . distinction remains , broad clear . one conception , whether called `` value use , '' `` marginal utility , '' `` subjective value , '' pertains wholly relation single good , unit group goods , bears single individual , society unit , respect human well-being , reference relation individual good . conception , called `` objective value , '' `` exchange value , '' dual nature , involving cases two commodities . abstractly , _the ratio commodities may exchanged other_ , , since ratio unit one commodity expressed amount another given , exchange value thing quantity thing evenly exchanged , , considered general sense , amount commodities general exchange , -- _its general purchasing power_ , short . latter conception -- exchange value -- one principally concerns us discussing subject money . also conception generally mind simple term _value_ used either economists general public , wherever term used work without qualification understood sense . austrian economist , e. von böhm-bawerk , says , `` positive theory capital , '' p. 130 : -- '' value subjective sense importance good , complex goods , possesses regard well-being subject . '' `` besides expression 'value exchange , ' english economists use , quite indifferently , expression 'purchasing power , ' germans beginning way put general use term _tauschkraft_ . '' value thing may considered either particular sense , reference specified thing , may considered general sense , reference things considered whole . may say value bushel wheat two bushels corn , meaning two commodities exchange ratio ; may speak value wheat risen fallen , meaning general purchasing power , ratio things taken unit whole , increased decreased . term must invariably used considered general sense , unless otherwise specifically stated , must always thing mind besides one whose value considering ; stated , commodities general ( taken whole ) thing . value ratio , impossible values rise fall simultaneously . sum subjective values may increase decrease , -- indeed one great objects human endeavour increase sum want-satisfying power , -- sum ratios subjective values constant . one term ratio rises relative , second necessarily falls regards first . principle universally recognized quotations might given almost every work political economy support . following sufficient , however , regards definition value principle . john stuart mill says , `` principles political economy '' : -- '' value relative term . value thing means quantity thing , things general , exchanges . values things never , therefore , rise fall simultaneously . thing general rise general fall values . every rise value supposes fall , every fall rise . '' , says : -- '' things exchanged one another fall , rise , dozen runners outstrip rest , hundred trees overtop one another . '' prof. s. n. patten says , `` dynamic economics , '' p. 64 : `` objective values , however , never sum , relation subjective values . never high low objective values commodities whole . therefore impossible add subtract . '' latter quotation , well preceding one von böhm-bawerk , -- exponents marginal utility theory , -- may help correct quite prevalent impression later theory distinguish two conceptions value , sum subjective values may increase , sum objective exchange values increase also . _supply demand._ economists recognize fact immediate determiner value relation supply demand . terms economic sense mean something mere desire mere quantity . _supply_ means amount offered exchange , _demand_ means desire , desire coupled ability willingness give commodities exchange one wanted . sense terms strictly correlative . supply commodity ( , amount offered ) may considered equivalent demand commodity , commodities general . may say , , value commodity determined ratio demand commodity bears supply ; ratio demand commodity bears demand commodity , -- commodities general , term _value_ used general sense reference specified thing . ( objection made writers ratio could logically exist desire [ demand ] quantity [ supply ] , apply terms economic sense ; , stated , something mere desire mere quantity , expression translatable expression , `` ratio demand one commodity demand others general . '' ) statement later economists exchange value depends , determined , ratio subjective values way conflicts statement value determined ratio demand supply , demand commodity determined subjective value alone , must vary . hence , quantity anything increases subjective value lessens , demand relative quantity articles also lessens , value falls , _vice versa_ . close connection value ratio demand supply -- value rising ratio increases , falling grows less -- true cases . factor affect value commodity except altering relation ratio two . cost production remote factor enters determination value cases , effect supply . used , like term _value_ , two senses , subjective objective sense . former means pain labour waiting must undergone produce good considered , -- negative pleasure given get positive pleasure derived good . objective sense -- sense generally used -- cost production means goods must otherwise given , bartered set desired ; simple case direct production , means goods might produced , lieu produced , subjective cost ; complex cases , means sum goods sacrificed , shape raw materials , rent , wages , interest , etc. , get one produced . value commodity falls cost production , even approaches closely reduce margin two -- producer 's profit -- industries , , men cease produce one turn labour capital producing others offer greater profit , thus lowering supply abandoned product raising profitable , thereby affecting value . effect operation law cost equalize profits make values things conform cost proportional thereto . law operate men free turn labour one industry another . hence arises important exception law , values goods produced monopoly affected cost production . free competition law operate full force . monopoly becomes factor cost ceases , , monopoly complete , cost weight whatever determination value . analogous reasons , cost enters partially determination value goods dependent less luck chance production , case precious stones , gold , silver , etc . _the standard value._ may use value anything measure compare values things , factors determine value variable , value everything variable . value may rise reference value , time fall reference third . standard , invariable measure times places , compare values goods determine constancy variability ? must forget two kinds value , standard exchange value seeking . far may possible formulate standard subjective value , must consist pain inutility labour ; kind value pertains single good , referred goods without confusing conception . measure absolute pleasure good give individual except pain undergo get . standard sort value want . evidently conception -- confusing , however , two kinds value two descriptions labour -- led adam smith consider labour ultimate standard value . appears also confused idea standard value determiner value . errors pointed part ricardo , part also , j. s. mill later writers ; hence contention labour way standard value long abandoned ablest economists . idea still lingers , however , frequently brought forward current discussions , reason seems necessary analyze briefly relation labour value . labour necessary production commodities , commodity , anything desired . force , , like every force , valuable according results accomplishes . unproductive , value ; productive , value varies according value commodities utilities creates . use terms `` price labour '' `` value labour , '' implying labour valued , bought sold ; terms merely convenience . really bought sold commodity utility labour produced produce . labour , purchaser would receive labour , commodity produced , exchange wages paid , -- double return , -- , course , absurd . three descriptions labour may distinguished connection value commodity , viz . : -- ( 1 ) labour expended production .

'' argument applies third form labour -- necessary produce commodity . form labour , however , one factors cost production , effect cost one remote factors determine value , explained considering cost production , make sense standard . may conclude , , labour form standard value ; , john stuart mill observes , `` discards idea exchange value altogether , substituting totally different idea , analogous value use . '' since values things never rise fall simultaneously , every rise supposing fall , every fall rise , follows values taken together must constant ; words , general values change . thus find whether one thing risen fallen value , one period another , comparing others , -- short , general exchange purchasing power . increased , value risen ; decreased , value fallen . evidently necessary anything exchange less _every_ thing show rise fall value , , average , exchange less ; average purchasing power greater less . exchanged different times amounts , average , things , value , clearly , remained constant . standard , test , applied exchange value commodity determine constancy variability , inherent definition exchange value . values commodities may compared surface ocean , , vexed winds tides , never rest , every point continually rising falling compared others . points rise others fall , yet mean level vary , comparison variations level particular point may determined . values , mean average constant , referring individual values determine fluctuations . ideas become clearer proceed apply concretely special case money . although one real _standard value_ , invariable times places , yet , stated , commodity may serve _measure value_ , great convenience subserved , people locality country using commodity instead number different ones purpose , early led adoption one commodity locality `` money '' measure values facilitate exchanges . chapter ii . money . _definition money._ money variously defined different writers . perhaps definition given prof. f. a. walker , though lengthy , comprehensive . says : `` money passes freely hand hand throughout community final discharge debts full payment commodities , accepted equally without reference character credit person offers , without intention person receives consume , enjoy , apply use turn tender others discharge debts full payment commodities . '' definition indorsed several writers ; , however , term _money_ restricted coin , paper money called currency . distinction perfectly proper , though generally concurred . people commonly use terms _money_ _currency_ indiscriminately coin paper money , since perform identically work used together , paper convertible coin time . paper used alone -- '' inconvertible paper '' -- coin really money ; ceases circulate money ; hoarded treasure , bought sold commodity , fails general use current transactions country alone entitles commodity called money . distinction sought made paper money coin arises largely , thought , idea coin value paper money . idea erroneous . value , seen , ratio relation , though value anything based desire , desire may arise either satisfaction use consumption bring , belief exchanged thing give satisfaction use consumption . value money due latter two causes . one wants money except purpose exchanging commodities ; modern conditions necessary purpose , -- indispensable requisite satisfaction certain human wants . money , therefore , possesses indirect direct subjective value forms basis exchange value . paper money possesses power satisfying need money extent coin , like conditions , , therefore , subjective value exchange value , latter governed law supply demand operates cases . fact material money made , one instance , great cost , , , little cost , minor consequence . minting gold silver coin may , may , add value ; really transforms another commodity -- money -- value thenceforth determined law supply demand applied money . true paper money , low cost production element determining value , production always monopoly . reason , , considering paper currency money , using term consider meaning given professor walker , -- also popular significance , -- including paper money coin . considered , whether one material several circulating concurrently , single commodity created purpose fulfils , separate distinct material made . short , commodity , common consent usage , generally sanctioned law , commodities referred measure value , means exchanges effected . _the functions requirements money._ professor jevons , valuable work , `` money mechanism exchange , '' gives money following threefold functions , viz . : -- medium exchange . measure value . standard deferred payments . also inquires perform fourth function 'store value . ' authorities give first two principal money functions . include one others , omit . prof. f. a. walker objects use term `` measure value , '' ground value , relation , measured expressed . proposes , instead , term , `` common denominator value . '' quite clear relation _or_ ratio measured , -- measure , course , similar ratio , -- seem anything gained change , term proposed seems less clear correct one general use . money , _value_ unit money , used measure comparing values things yardstick , _length_ yard , used comparing lengths objects . money , acting medium exchange , must also act store value extent , since stores value received expended ; use money purpose hoarding regarded strictly one functions , least sense requiring especially provided . fact used , however , borne mind , interferes less important functions ; considering qualities necessary best performance functions money may omit last function , money fills requirements others fulfil necessary sufficient degree considering minor importance . inquiries work confined money materials general use , viz. , gold , silver , paper , need consider qualities necessary money material , given professor jevons , -- portability , indestructibility , divisibility , etc. , -- say qualities mentions possessed money materials use , sufficient nearly equal degree . coin , sure , indestructible paper ; paper sufficiently acceptable purpose , difference need concern us . aside general acceptability , essence money , -- without commodity could considered money , , therefore , money may considered , -- great requirements money _invariable value_ , added _convenience form_ , _size_ , _weight_ , _and value_ . latter requirement pertains function medium exchange , degree possessed different money materials kinds money , depends wholly values transferred use . small amounts , silver preferable either gold paper ; amount increases , gold becomes preferable silver ; amounts fractional currency , paper money unquestionably convenient every way either gold silver , advantage increases amount . _invariable value_ great requirement functions , -- '' measure value '' `` standard deferred payments .

'' _per contra_ , therefore , unless currency increased meet increased demand , tendency decreased prices consequent change value money . stronger statements mill 's , abler authority , could asked . prof. r. t. ely , `` political economy , '' remarks , p. 179 : -- '' values merely relative , consequently thing general rise fall values . '' `` value expressed money called price . thing general fall general rise prices . general fall prices means increase value money , general rise prices means fall value money .

advocate free coinage silver claim value gold increased since free silver coinage stopped , value silver remained nearly constant . claim , seen , correct . claim desire substitute silver gold coinage , use together ratio 15.988 1 , bi-metallic system , increasing volume money , thereby raising prices higher level . opponents say free silver coinage drive gold country value standard fall present bullion value silver ( 50 60 cents , measured gold ) , bi-metallism practicable agreement leading nations . free coinage silver would result driving gold country largely denied advocates measure . denial make great mistake , statement strictly true , theory experience past alike shown , also would accomplish aiming , way accomplished silver coinage . increase volume money would raise prices , flow gold countries would raise prices also , thus general rise prices lowering value gold , would result . gold-standard advocates also made error supposing free silver coinage would result _immediate_ fall standard present bullion value silver dollar . would rather difficult trace immediate effects measure , several conflicting forces would brought play , relative strengths could foretold . seems probable , however , first effect would large rise price silver bullion , hoarding gold , followed export exchange silver . time would cause fall prices commodities , followed rise , new coinage began fill place gold hoarded exported . however might , hardly doubted final result would rise prices commodities -- including silver -- measured gold , fall value gold world measured commodities . money would probably remain slight depreciation gold standard , together would gradually lower . condition would made manifest gradually increasing prices , would continue either available gold exported , rising value silver met falling value gold coinage ratio 15.98 1 . whichever results took place would depend relative amounts gold available export silver import , could hardly foretold . seems likely , however , gold would exported . case , country would silver standard , value dollar would somewhat lower value gold dollar , considerably lower value gold dollar , also considerably higher bullion value silver dollar . two dollars reached parity coinage ratio gold exported , country would bi-metallic standard , would practically force standard rest world , long least gold supply held . foreign nations returned also free coinage silver , would either change ratio agree , , kept present ratio 15-1/2 1 , silver would gradually leave us exchange gold . fear sudden fall value dollar , result free silver coinage , justified . value dollar would fall gradually volume money increased , -- would made manifest gradually rising prices , -- except fall would less counteracted start hoarding gold , would decrease supply money , perhaps disturbance credit , would increase demand . first effects might , therefore , increase instead decrease money value . would probably make much difference whether bi-metallism single silver standard final result . value dollar would greatly different two cases . reached silver basis would exported five six hundred millions gold , bought equivalent silver , securities , commodities , result would necessarily great advance value silver , corresponding fall value gold , -- reverse , fact , happened germany nations changed silver gold basis . whether , therefore , country able restore parity two metals present coinage ratio , departure parity would nearly great . provided volume uncovered paper money remained , , change finally accomplished , credit used extent , value dollar would somewhere present bullion values gold silver dollars , probably nearly high result single silver standard would bi-metallism accomplished . merits demerits plan may summed follows : -- change would necessarily cause great disturbance business , might result , first , lowering prices , would eventually result gradual considerable increase general prices , stimulation industry . debtors would benefited considerably , creditors wronged considerably , especially short-time obligations ; though long-time ones -- run number years -- would affected much . established , money value would probably less variable gold , rather variable silver past , could said certainty , money value would continue result variety

deposited , would uneconomical system , since greater part silver might evidently well ground dug , far real use concerned . paper issued excess silver deposited , would make market much silver use , value silver would raised little . value money would therefore depend largely use made paper connection . without control volume money besides control supply silver would give , value would continue fluctuate times , greatly times panic , always done . proper control silver wholly unnecessary , use limit volume money , done far cheaply efficiently ways . little need said `` greenback '' fiat
