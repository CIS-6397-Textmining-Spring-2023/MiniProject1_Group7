conditions favorable bull market , prices go much higher . like manner , rallies bear markets . course professional bears sell rallies , expectation buying later cheaper price . minor price changes mean majority traders major movements . major movements slow people get patience , yet guided major movements operating much safer basis . believe greater amount money made , minimum risk , guided principally major movements , taking advantage minor movements minor way . however , stocks move uniformly frequently opportunity buy particular stock bargain nearly stocks selling high . try pick opportunities clients . reports earnings various companies influence stock prices , also paying extra dividends passing dividends . peculiar psychological influence noticed company declares extra dividend . price stock usually goes , matter fact intrinsic value stock decreased amount dividend ; sometimes advisable sell stock shortly advance dividend rate . chapter xiv . technical conditions technical conditions refer conditions usually affect supply demand , short interests , floating supply , stop loss orders . sometimes said supply demand must equal else could sales , . always people willing sell price market sell market ; demand stock greater supply , goes supplied people holding higher price . works way supply greater demand . always people buy price market . therefore , supply greater demand prices must go . stock may intrinsic value $ 100 share yet selling $ 50 share , never sell higher $ 50 stock offered price bought . however , keep mind : real value $ 100 share , sooner later market price approach figure . strongly urge clients buy stocks actual values , least prospective values far greater market prices , either buy outright margin heavily , hold prices go . course , one finds mistake made , sooner one sells takes loss better . chapter xv . manipulations stock prices influenced largely manipulation . years ago volume trading new york stock exchange small compared today , possible influence entire market manipulation , would difficult today . certain stocks manipulated ; conditions favorable , many stocks may influenced . different kinds manipulation . one insiders company give unfavorable news company want price stock go , buy ; give favorable news want price go , sell . method practiced extent years ago . public opinion strongly opposed , believe business men acquiring higher standard business ethics . methods kind legal morally reprehensible . another method manipulation forming pools buy stock company force . market price stock far real value , believe justifiable pool force , ordinary pool merely scheme rob public . four periods operation pools . first period accumulation . number large holders stock certain company pool stock , agreeing sell except pool , benefit proportionately . give bad news company . easy , financial writers usually accept news given without much investigation , especially writers daily papers , time investigate . copy must ready hours get information . see chapter xxv . `` market information '' fuller explanation reason financial news usually misleading . manipulators stock prices financial news '' made order . '' general public reads news sees stock going , many get discouraged sell . time sell , well known fact majority people stock market . sell price goes , pool operators accumulate stock . secured stock want , give good news continue buy stock starts go . public reads favorable news , seeing stock go , go market buy , puts higher . time financial writers supplying good news stock public buys . sold , public may still anxious , pool operators may go short stock . begin giving bad news , buy stock lower price cover short interests . little interest market . declining fast , may support occasionally buying stock giving favorable news . make market rally sell newly acquired stock near top rally . manipulations kind appear going nearly time , seem limit number suckers fall . , one ca n't blame public realize thoroughly unreliable market information given . still another kind manipulation `` one-man '' manipulation , one man controls companies , known `` one-man '' companies . usually directors companies friends employees , many instances resignations possession , must whatever wants . owing strict rules new york stock exchange , rather difficult manipulations carried . many new york curb . curb operating street much control , manipulations kind frequent . example , suppose man kind mining company . wants stock go , sends stockholders great deal information work mine , perhaps sends telegram new vein rich ore found . stockholders rush buy stock , puts price . unloads stock extent buy . day two , stock may drop back less one half selling . `` one-man '' manipulator wants buy stock , give little unfavorable news , get stock price . news good bad according whether manipulator wants buy sell , rule abundance stock wants sell , continually giving good news . years ago man operating new york promoted several companies manipulated large way . business , thing still done smaller way . opinion money lost public manipulated stocks promotion stocks , read great deal enormous losses . promotions failures may perfectly legitimate conducted utmost good faith , manipulations nearly always purpose swindling public . however , lure great many people withstand temptations even `` trimmed '' several times . _part four_ topics interest speculators chapter xvi . marginal trading people trade stocks buy margin . ordinary minimum margin 20 % purchase price , banks usually lend 80 % market value stocks . put 20 % purchase price stocks broker , pay 80 % , borrowing amount bank , putting stock security . way brokers able handle margin business comes , long money borrowed . course , stocks accepted banks collateral loans , expect broker sell stocks margin . fact , offers , looks though running bucket shop . see chapter xviii . many people think buying stocks margin gambling people reason , buying margin done lines business , although may known name . bought stock outright , borrowed 80 % purchase price banker complete payment put stock security , would buying margin . like manner , bought home paid 20 % money borrowed 80 % purchase price , would buying home margin . principal difference buy broker margin , one conditions contract right sell stock provided market price drops amount owe stock , whereas borrow money home , usually certain specified time lender sell time expires . however , principle , little difference two transactions . margin traders put sufficient margin . put minimum margin , broker right call margin price stock declines . unless fully prepared times put additional margin called upon , make smaller purchases put heavy margin buy . amount margin depends upon transaction , advise 30 % 50 % , times advise less 50 % margin purchase . fact times advise buy stocks margin . wish entirely free worry buy stocks prices low , pay full , get certificates , put away safe deposit box . however , stocks low risk buying liberal margin small , possibilities profit much greater , see objection taking advantage method trading . chapter xvii . short selling short selling , mean selling stock possess , intention buying later . short selling general business common , think nothing . manufacturers frequently sell goods yet made , delivered future time . selling stocks short similar transaction , except majority cases delivery stock must made immediately . however , broker attend borrowing stock . explained preceding chapter , market active trading done margin . broker buys stock , pay full , customary take bank borrow money . bank usually lends 80 % market value , broker wants borrow stock , lend full value . particular stock scarce hard get , lender stock may get use money without interest . therefore , advantage broker lending stock , reason nearly always possible broker arrange delivery stock wish sell short . instruct later buy stock , deliver broker borrowed , return money received . sell stock short price goes , pay higher price . therefore , protect possibility losing , broker demands payment pay margin buy stock . short selling something recommend much clients . think advisable short selling long good opportunities make money buying ; bargains disappear , sometimes , must either sell short else keep market entirely . times , may many opportunities make money short selling , consider reason clients take advantage . course , great care must exercised selling stocks short . might sell stock short know market price 100 % greater real value , possible manipulators force great deal higher ; able put sufficient money broker protect , buy high price lose money put . instances , stocks cornered short interests forced buy stocks prices represent enormous losses . common thing read short interests certain stocks . stocks sold short must bought sooner later , buying takes place , may affect market much . therefore , known big short interest certain stock , expect stock sell higher price ; sometimes short interests break market force price , especially general conditions favor . chapter xviii . bucket shops much publicity given bucket shops , nearly everybody familiar term . broker runs bucket shop sells stock clients margin either never buys stock accounts , else sells immediately buying . bucket shop simply gets money supposition likely wrong right . course , take bucket shop 's advice surely likely wrong . bucket shops get clients speculative stocks , likely great deal fluctuation price stocks , gives frequent opportunities sell clients . market going many movements price stocks , bucket shops make money rapidly , occasionally long period market working bucket shops , unless great deal money must fail . august , 1921 , stock exchange stocks started go . upward movement slow continual . time writing , three-point reaction , except stocks , time . without fluctuating market , bucket shop chance clean customers . consequence , bucket shops began fail early part 1922 , present writing ( april , 1922 ) fifty failures . however , likely bucket shops put business . successful ones likely `` weather storm . '' many laws enacted bucket shops , believe way found get rid future time ; expect happen soon , warn readers get hands , get money away one way likely get way . man runs bucket shop usually conscience , certainly unfortunate thing anyone get mixed man . chapter xix . choosing broker important choose good broker . matter careful , possible make mistake . however , choose broker member new york stock exchange , eliminated large percentage chances getting wrong broker . occasionally member stock exchange fails one suspended running bucket shop connected one , instances rare compared number brokers get trouble members new york stock exchange . rules regulations stock exchange protect great extent . buy stock margin , leave money hands broker , know responsible . matter broker , get report . subscriber bradstreet 's dun 's agencies , get report . subscriber mercantile agency , perhaps friend get report , bank may get one . banks make practice getting reports kind clients . asked , send clients names brokers members new york stock exchange , prefer recommend broker . course , guarantee broker right . simply use best judgment , , said , eliminate large percentage chances going wrong trade broker member new york stock exchange . chapter xx . puts calls `` put '' negotiable contract giving holder privilege sell specified number shares certain stock maker fixed price , within specified time . `` call '' exact reverse . negotiable contract giving holder privilege buy specified number shares certain stock maker fixed price , within specified time . price fixed put call set away market price certain number points , depending upon stock condition market . market steady fluctuating , price fixed frequently two points away , active market considerably . instance , present time , u. s. steel selling 95 , buy call 97 put 93 . paying certain amount , present $ 137.50 , privilege buying 100 shares u. s. steel 97 , within thirty days date purchase call . steel go 101 could broker buy 97 sell market , would make profit four points , less cost call commissions . method operating stock market , recommend buying puts calls . professional speculators may able use advantage sometimes , outsider , close touch market , nothing recommend . one point : people sell puts calls fix terms . market irregular , set point buying selling far away market price . people shrewd traders make terms favor . generally said nearly buyers puts calls lose , opinion . therefore , advise leave alone . chapter xxi . stop loss orders `` stop-loss '' order broker sell market sells certain number points . many speculators place stop loss orders two points market price . idea market starts go likely continue going , taking two-point loss may save much greater loss . also applied short sale , give broker instructions buy stock goes certain number points . read much financial news stop-loss orders merely stop orders , thing , average reader likely get idea something must use protection , opinion something used seldom trade along broad lines recommended us . purchases made stocks cheap , continue hold case reaction . bought outright substantial margin , danger , look upon loss merely paper loss . great majority cases , great deal better hold stocks would stop-loss order . large number stop-loss orders good thing short interests . let us take u. s. steel , example . suppose selling 94 believed large number stop-loss orders 92 . short interests may sell stock heavily force 92 . brokers stop-loss orders would begin sell ; would force price still lower , short interests could buy cover lower price . therefore , believe stop-loss orders bad thing , rule , recommend . one instance stop-loss order used advantage , near top bull market . impossible tell market reached top . sell soon , may lose profit several points . course , better take chance large loss . case , might instruct broker place stop-loss order two points market , keep moving market price moves . reaction come , sell prevent losing large part profit . instance recommend stop-loss order , recommend clients sometimes , although seldom . stock selling 100 would suggest make stop loss order least three points market , stocks selling 100 , two-point stop-loss order might used . however , number points decided upon particular case . special instructions clients , tell think use stop-loss order advantage . _part five_ concluding chapters chapter xxii . desire speculate said desire speculate strong american people . country made greater progress country world , progress result speculation . referring merely stock speculations , word broadest sense . every new undertaking speculation . inventor speculates going invent . often speculations result losses , many inventors , would-be-inventors , never accomplish much . spend money , time , efforts , probably live years poverty , invention profitable , heavy losers . many inventors spend best years lives poverty never succeed . hear great deal succeed , little fail -- whose speculations unsuccessful -- except somebody accuses crooks solicited money promotion inventions succeed . thing every new business . purely speculation . common saying 95 % commercial undertakings fail . know statement correct , question number failures great , shows great risk going new undertaking . far greater risk involved stock speculating done accordance advice given book . yet , would progress without speculating kind . entering new business would make careful study venture entering , would exercise greater care judgment conducting , number failures would much less . thing true stock speculating . failures stock speculating caused mainly ignorance greediness . many people would satisfied fair return money business enterprise , think ought make 100 % profit weeks stock speculation . something stock speculation appeals greediness pure gambling instincts people . chapter manipulation , told stock prices put . outsider accidentally buys one stocks price starts . thirty days made several hundred per cent profit . realize purely accidental far concerned , tries thing , loses profits probably capital well . stock gambler ( use word `` gambler '' refer man operates ignorantly ) watching large number extremely speculative stocks suddenly notices one takes big jump price . says , `` bought stock ten-point margin , would made several hundred per cent profit .
